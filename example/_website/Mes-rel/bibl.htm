        <p>In this essay, the author traces the history of the major versions (Old Babylonian, eleven-tablet, and twelve-tablet) of the <strong>Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh</strong> and examines the development of meaning from one version to the next. Abusch discusses the <strong>changing emphases in contents and sensitivity</strong> of the three versions of the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh: in particular, he offers a detailed <strong>analysis of the different reactions of the hero in front of the death of his friend Enkidu</strong>.
In all three versions, Gilgamesh seeks immortality as a human being, and yet he always comes to the conclusion that his desire cannot be accomplished. In the Old Babylonian version, he has to accept the fact that immortality may only be obtained within the bosom of the family, by giving life to children who will represent him in the future. In the eleven-tablet version, he ultimately becomes a responsible ruler whose wisdom leads to the creation of such achievements that will outlast his own reign. Finally, in the twelve-tablet version, he prepares himself to become a god whose reign is the Netherworld itself, and whose task is to judge the dead for eternity.</p>

        <p>Decades in the making, this massive four volume work brought together by Abusch et. al. is a new edited comprehensive collection of relevant Mesopotamian anti-witchcraft ritual texts (i.e, those which were created to ward off the effects of witchcraft, or black magic).  The authors describe the nature of anti-witchcraft literature (in essence, a subsidiary of divination) in brief, but succinct detail at the outset of the first volume.  They then proceed to organize the massive text corpus in a somewhat ‘non user-friendly’ way. Texts from the same collection of texts (named as Groups) are interspersed throughout the three volumes (the fourth volume is a collection of the glossary and indices).  The interested reader will get the impression as to how normative these texts were; individuals (who had the resources), regularly consulted the religious technicians to determine which ritual text would help them in their romantic, personal, business, or legal dealings.</p>

        <p>This volume brings together the proceedings of a conference on Mesopotamian magic and divination which was held in 1995 at the &lsquo;Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences&rsquo;: the result is a most useful collection of some significant contributions to the study of Mesopotamian magic - of which we provide a very short synthesis below.</p>
<p>The book opens with an article by W. van Binsbergen and F. Wiggermann&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Magic in history: A theoretical perspective, and its application to ancient Mesopotamia&rdquo;, pp. 1-34) in which the authors discuss the role of magic within the Mesopotamian society. In &ldquo;The poetry of magic,&rdquo; (pp. 35-48). N. Veldhuis offers an analysis of various Old-Babylonian incantations used in magic rituals in order to influence the course of the earthly events. M.J. Geller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freud and Mesopotamian magic&rdquo; (pp. 49-55) attempts to assess the psychological impact of magic both on Mesopotamian society as a whole, and on the individual&rsquo;s psyche. A similar topic is the center of the following article, written by M. Stol (&ldquo;Psychosomatic suffering in ancient Mesopotamia,&rdquo; pp. 57-68). J.A. Scurlock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Physician, Exorcist, Conjurer, Magician: A Tale of Two Healing Professionals&rdquo; (pp.69-79) investigates and tries to better delineate the two professions attested in ancient Mesopotamia - that of the physician and of the pharmacist. </p>
<p>Tz. Abusch, &ldquo;Witchcraft and the anger of the personal god&rdquo; (pp. 83-121) describes how different evils and calamities that were originally attributed to entities of the divine realm, especially to the anger of the personal god, came to be interpreted as induced by witches. In &ldquo;How the Babylonians protected themselves against calamities announced by omens&rdquo; (pp. 123-129), S.M. Maul demonstrates how each stage of the Mesopotamian mental construction of evil and protection against evil had its material counterpart in the <em>namburbi</em> ritual procedures. A. Livingstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;The magic of time&rdquo; (pp. 131-137) examines some temporal expressions found in magical texts, while K. van der Toorn (&ldquo;Magic at the cradle: A reassessment&rdquo;, pp. 139-147) focuses on a small group of incantations against crying babies. E. A. Braun-Holzinger, in &ldquo;Apotropaic figures at Mesopotamian temples in the third and second millennia&rdquo; (pp. 149-172) analyzes the apotropaic figures set up at the facades of Mesopotamian public buildings; in &ldquo;The poetics of spells: Language and structure in Aramaic incantations of Late Antiquity. 1: The divorce formula and its ramifications&rdquo; (pp. 173-195) </p>
<p>Sh. Shaked discusses the magical formulae attested in divorce spells used to drive away demons from possessed patients. In her article &ldquo;Interrelations between Mandaic lead rolls and incantation bowls&rdquo; (pp. 197-209) Ch. Miiller-Kessler suggests that a continuation of an older Babylonian magical tradition may be recognized in some parts of these Mandaic magic texts of Late Antiquity. I.L. Finkel&rsquo;s  &ldquo;On some dog, snake and scorpion incantations&rdquo; (pp. 213-250) offers the edition for 16 Old- and Late-Babylonian incantations against venomous and dangerous creatures. A. Cavigneaux, &ldquo;A scholar&rsquo;s library in Meturan? With an edition of the tablet H 72 (Textes de Tell Haddad VII)&rdquo; (pp.251-273) examines the Old-Babylonian literary lot excavated in Me-turan - while W.W. Hallo, in &ldquo;More incantations and rituals from the Yale Babylonian Collection&rdquo; (pp. 275-289) offers editions with copies of two Old-Babylonian Lamastu-incantations and a late astronomical omen tablet. The last contribution to this volume is W.G. Lambert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marduk&rsquo;s Address to the Demons&rdquo; (pp. 291-296), in which the scholar outlines and analyzes in detail the different sections of the text.</p>

        <p>In this article Albright stresses the limitations with comparing &laquo;religious literature of the Ancient Near East&raquo;, emphasizing the need for philological reliability. He assigns three qualifiers needed before achieving a legitimate basis for interpretation: decipherment, philological study, and &ldquo;detailed dialectic and syntactic research&rdquo;. Citing philological developments in <strong>Egyptology</strong> and <strong>Assyriology</strong>, with some advancement in <strong>Anatolian languages</strong>, Albright notes that the study of <strong>Hittite</strong> and <strong>West Semitic</strong> has not yet achieved the same status. Thus, religious interpretation should remain limited as the grounds for &laquo;philological interpretation&raquo; are minimal. Albright also provides concise summaries of philological advancements in <strong>Ugaritic</strong> and <strong>South Arabian</strong>.</p>
<p>Juxtaposing developments made within these ancient cultures, Albright is heavily critical of methodologies within Old Testament studies, often citing blatant disregards by notable OT scholars. Albright directly attacks and illustrates the limitations of &laquo;Hegelianism&raquo;, notably the evolutionist models reflecting positivism as the preferred methodology within the &laquo;philosophy of histories&raquo; prevalent in OT scholarship. Following this extensive critique, Albright goes on to give a systematic analysis comparing &laquo;religious qualities of the Ancient Near East&raquo;, citing <strong>cross-cultural</strong> similarities while also highlighting notable differences.</p>

        <p>The paper briefly displays the development (during the Middle Ages) of the <strong>euhemerism</strong> as a way of interpreting history of religious phaenomena, and the nature of gods as perceived during the classical times and the later Middle Ages. According to the Alphandéry, during this last period, many intellectuals read the classical authors trying to find in their compositions (both in prose and in verses), the origin of specific religious (and consequently, also literary) features (such as the ‘hermeticism’, the magic, and the alchemy), sketching (throughout many literary exemplifications) a useful history of euhemerism.  </p>
<p>[Euhemerism is a topic discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume; the reader will find in this paper a useful historical reconstruction, along with a critical comment, of the development of euhemerism, particularly during the Middle Ages.]</p>

        <p>In this paper, Alster describes a peculiar aspect of <strong>Sumerian wisdom texts</strong>, i.e. the use of <strong>proverbs and satirical expressions</strong>. The study underlines how humour, irony, and sarcasm are deliberately applied by ancient scribes as &laquo;indirect means of communication which only make sense when seen in a tacit opposition to something else&raquo; (p. 201). The rhetorical use of proverbs and satirical expressions aims at provoking an indirect effect on the reader: &laquo;The effect of the indirect expression is much stronger than that of the direct one, but of course only if it is understood by the one to whom it is addressed. An even sharper effect will appear if the message is understood by a third person, but not by the one to whom it is addressed, or if it is placed in the mouth of one who does not himself understand it&raquo; (p. 201). </p>
<p>[This paper well exemplifies the mindset of ancient Sumerian scribes in writing wisdom compositions, recurring also to rhetorical expedients which allowed them to obtain an indirect, stronger, and sometimes alienating effect on the reader.]</p>

A particularly interesting tablet from Susa published by Durand (1990) with many unusual syllabic writings is edited in its entirety. Two new sources from the California Museum of Ancient Art in Los Angeles are published for the first time, resulting in an improved reconstruction of lines 71-89. Two sources from the Schøyen collection in Oslo are also published here for the first time.

        <p>&ldquo;How and when did religions originate? The study of prehistoric art is
revolutionizing our knowledge of prehistoric religions. The rock art
sites have been places of worship and tribal identity for millennia,
serving as archives of myths, beliefs and rites, all of which evolved,
diversified and acquired regional and ethnic features. Visual art,
however, is not the earliest evidence of the presence of religion.
Archeological discoveries of burial customs and burial goods
accompanying the dead in their journey to the other world, and newly
discovered prehistoric shrines, reveal concepts and beliefs going back
even before the origins of art. When and how were the first religious
concepts and rituals conceived? And how did religions acquire their
present shape? As presented in this book, the evolution of archeological and
anthropological evidence and analysis contribute a
new look to the origins and history of religion.&rdquo; [Editor&rsquo;s summary]</p>

        <p>&laquo;The study of <strong>signs</strong>, portents observed in the physical and social worlds indicating the will of supernatural agents and the course of future events, was undoubtedly important in all ancient cultures. The first written evidence for a concept of signs, however, comes from cuneiform texts of ancient Mesopotamia. The study of signs from gods was vitally important for ancient Mesopotamians throughout their history. … Subsequently, consulting the will of gods is a well-attested practice in ancient Mesopotamia, accompanying every significant political or private action or undertaking.&raquo; (from editor’s <em>Introduction</em> on p. 1) </p>

        <p>Author’s summary: The biblical god is often an angry god. The lexical fields of <strong>divine wrath</strong> as well as the wide number of references leave no doubt about this statement. However, the biblical god manifests no such anger in the flood story whereas in Mesopotamian sources the flood itself has come to symbolize divine wrath. Even more, it is <strong>divine repentance</strong> that enacts the biblical flood and the destruction of humanity. It is the object of this communication to analyze the literary structures and the narrative function of wrath and repentance in the Mesopotamian flood story <em>Atra-hasis</em> and the biblical flood narrative (Gn 6–9:17), compare them and show their ideological and theological differences. </p>
<p>[Anthonioz emphasizes the differences between the Biblical flood narrative in Gn 6 and the Mesopotamian flood story <em>Atra-hasis</em>. She describes the two main interpretations of the Mesopotamian flood. First, the moral cause that men carried in themselves the rebellion of the Igigi and made ‘noise’ (see Buccellati <em>When</em> 8.5) (<em>rigmu</em>). Second, that there were too many people, and that their ‘noise’ was proportional to their number, so they were killed in order to reduce the disturbance. The myth follows by explaining Enlil’s actions as deriving from a paroxysm of anger toward another god, Enki. The flood is later mitigated because of the action of the goddess. Note that in all of this, anger and repentance in the god do not refer to man as their object or real cause. They serve more of a &laquo;narrative purpose&raquo;. (p. 306) </p>
<p>The Biblical story is quite different. The cause of the flood is sin, a direct and personal affront to the creator. (See Buccellati <em>When</em> chapter 8.) YHWH does not become angry; he simply responds to corruption with destruction. Human ‘noise’ or multiplication is not the cause of his action, so much so that after the flood, he repeats the commandment to multiply. The flood happens &laquo;in order to never happen again&raquo; (p. 310), and signals the end of divine anger. The many occurrences of divine anger later in the Bible happen only after the alliance on Sinai, in reference to human disobedience.] </p>

        <p>This volume aims to investigate the way divine speech is articulated and mediated in various societies of the past by making use of a comparative approach. It has a strong focus, thus, on the &lsquo;materialization&rsquo; of divine speech and the importance of artefacts as media. Two contributions are particularly relevant for Buccellati&rsquo;s discussion on prophecy in Ancient Mesopotamia and the Bible.</p>
<p>Martti Nissinen (&ldquo;Oracles as Artefacts: The Material Aspect of Prophecy&rdquo;, pp. 49-64) shares with Buccellati&rsquo;s approach a particular attention towards the temporal and cultural gap that exists between the modern readers and the people who produced and used the original texts. In this essay, he gives a brief presentation of four case-studies: an oracle collection from Nineveh; the Deir Alla inscription; the compilation of inscriptions from the Phrygian Hierapolis; and the scrolls containing &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; texts among the Dead Sea Scrolls. He considers these sources as material objects which are ultimately the results of a process of communication starting from the (possible) prophetic performance, the writing of the text to the audience, and the afterlife of the artefact carrying the message.</p>
<p>St&#233;phanie Anthonioz (&ldquo;Biblical Prophecy: Writing and Media Associated&rdquo;, pp. 65-80) opens her contribution with a definition of prophecy: &laquo;when a person, through some cognitive experience (vision, audition, apparition, dream or else) becomes the recipient of a divine revelation and is conscious to be sent to reveal it by speech or symbolical gesture to a precise audience.&raquo; (p. 65) She is aware, however, that this is an &lsquo;-etic&rsquo; definition, which highlights the principle of communication upon which the prophetic practice is based. Prophecy, she maintains, is subject to a continuous recontextualizations, linked to its transmission - and the question of the medium becomes essential to the very definition of prophecy and of its function. The author, thus, addresses the question of the relation between the prophetic word and its medium in biblical texts, analysing two specific instances: the book of the law as divine speech revealed to Moses, and prophetic books in relation with the scrolls when these are textually referred to.</p>

        <p>Beginning with a royal inscription from Gudea, thrones belonging to many gods were worshipped in temples during every period of Mesopotamian history. This article discusses the <strong>importance of divine thrones in Mesopotamian religious imagery</strong> and how this cultic practice can elucidate understanding of religious belief. Despite being listed in royal inscriptions and other textual sources, the author notes that material culture is the common basis for interpreting religious imagery as textual evidence is limited to de facto statements of name and length of reign (despite some descriptions of throne designs). Citing royal inscriptions that describe the manufacturing of thrones, Arkhipov suggests an investigation to correlate materials mentioned with iconography.</p>
<p>Information from the Old Babylonian Mari archives mentions a throne dedicated to Dagan of Terqa was constructed during the reign of Zimri-Lim. In addition to a letter from Zimri-Lim&rsquo;s secretary, the throne is mentioned in two letters and 16 accounting documents from Mari - all of which describe the illustrious manufacturing process and raw material materiality of the throne with emphasis on gold, silver, and precious stones used. The letter cites seven goldsmiths tasked with construction, four mentioned by name, all of whom are known from other accounting documents detailing the processes of their manufacturing and the corresponding information with respect to materials used. Arkhipov offers a hypothetical sketch of how the throne may have looked in accordance with descriptions made from texts where the throne of Dagan is mentioned, in addition to correlations made from iconography.</p>
<p>The article sheds light on throne construction and the relevance to religious iconography. Arkhipov lists the Akkadian names given to significant materials used in the construction of thrones. His methodology utilizes text and material culture to reproduce a hypothetical sketch.</p>

        <p>Asad challenges the category of belief and of religion itself. The author rejects essentialist definitions of religion and advocates an entirely different conceptual and methodological framework from that developed by symbolic anthropology. He is more concerned with power and discipline, and in fact he begins with the assumption that religion and power cannot be separated - stating that &laquo;this separation of religion from power is a modern Western norm, the product of a unique post-Reformation history.&raquo; In order to prove his theory, Asad starts from Clifford Geertz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Religion as a Cultural System&rdquo; (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Geertz1973ReligionCulturalSystem">Geertz 1973 Religion Cultural System</a>), maintaining that his intention &laquo;is to try to identify some of the historical shifts that have produced our concept of religion as the concept of a transhistorical essence&raquo;. Asad claims that <strong>there cannot be &laquo;a universal definition of religion, not only because its constituent elements and relationships are historically specific, but because that definition is itself the historical product of discursive processes.&raquo;</strong></p>
<p>He therefore analyses Geertz&rsquo;s definition of religion to prove that &laquo;a transhistorical definition of religion is not viable.&raquo; Asad sees the end of the eighteenth century as the moment in which the very idea that religion is essentially a matter of symbolic meanings linked to ideas of general order (expressed through either or both rite and doctrine) ultimately arose as part of the Christian history. In his own words, from Kant onwards &laquo;From being a concrete set of practical rules attached to specific processes of power and knowledge, religion has come to be abstracted and universalized.&raquo;</p>
<p>Asad ultimately maintains that &laquo;Geertz&rsquo;s treatment of religious belief, which lies at the core of his conception of religion, is a modern, privatized Christian one because and to the extent that it emphasizes the priority of belief as a state of mind rather than as constituting activity in the world.&raquo;</p>

        <p>&laquo;Standing at the very foundation of monotheism, and so of Western culture, Moses is a figure not of history, but of <strong>memory</strong>. As such, he is the quintessential subject for the innovative historiography Jan Assmann both defines and practices in this work, the study of historical memory &ndash; a study, in this case, of the ways in which factual and fictional events and characters are stored in religious beliefs and transformed in their philosophical justification, literary reinterpretation, philological restitution (or falsification), and psychoanalytic demystification. To account for the complexities of the foundational event through which monotheism was established, <em>Moses the Egyptian</em> goes back to the short-lived monotheistic [henotheistic; mDP] revolution of the Egyptian king Akhenaten (1360-1340 BC). Assmann traces the monotheism of Moses to this source, then shows how his followers denied the Egyptians any part in the origin of their beliefs and condemned them as <strong>polytheistic idolaters</strong>. Thus began the cycle in which every ‘counter-religion,’ by establishing itself as truth, denounced all others as false. Assmann reconstructs this cycle as a pattern of historical abuse, and tracks its permutations from ancient sources, including the Bible, through Renaissance debates over the basis of religion to Sigmund Freud’s <em>Moses and Monotheism</em>&raquo; (after book’s presentation online).</p>
<p>[The book faces the discussion of the role of history, fiction, and memory in the construction and build-up of a religious, monotheistic thought. Despite the Egyptian apports on Hebrew monotheism and the history of Exodus from Egypt is still on debate (cf. e.g. <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Liverani2009Oltre">Liverani 2009 Oltre</a>), this book well sets and critically discusses the fundamental questions still opened on this topic.]</p>

        <p>The author&rsquo;s purpose is to focus, within the realm of ancient Mesopotamian religion, on the cosmology and mysticism of the <em>melammu</em> - which is defined as &laquo;a dazzling radiance of a fearful sort associated with certain divine beings and objects&raquo; (p. 295). Ataç believes that, in ancient Mesopotamian literature, a few instances may be identified in which an individual exposed to the sight of the <em>melammu</em> undergoes such a religious experience that he/she is ultimately transformed; the author also maintains that the mythical description of the usurpation of <em>melammu</em> from one deity to another actually alludes to shifts within the perceived cosmic power structure. In order to explain and strenghten his argument, Ataç makes use of parallels from the mythology and literature of ancient Greece.</p>

    <td class="summary">
        <p>This article explores the theme of the &laquo;sleeping God&raquo; as it appears in different Ancient Near Eastern Motifs. Batto contrasts the themes of God(s) sleeping, arising, and exacting divine reign during the night, to instances in &laquo;Psalms&raquo;, &laquo;Canaanite&raquo; and &laquo;Mesopotamian&raquo; traditions. Batto illustrates his stance clearly, suggesting that the biblical motif directly reflects a more ancient Near Eastern origin. He suggests that two principals properly characterize the sleeping god motif: A) &ldquo;rest as a divine preogrative&rdquo; and B) &ldquo;sleeping as a symbol of divine rule&rdquo;. Batto cites instances from Mesopotamian/Ancient Near Eastern stories wherein &laquo;cries&raquo; awaken sleeping gods, intimating that this trope may reflect periods of hardship (famine, drought, etc.). Despite mentioning texts and traditions from an array of cultures within the Near East, Batto&rsquo;s focus remains with the &laquo;Enuma Elish&raquo; and the &laquo;Chaoskampf&raquo; motif. Building on this, he contrasts these tropes with those in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, making direct correlations to Chaoskampf motifs that he believes are utilized to convey the need for God&rsquo;s intervention, his divine authority, and his effectiveness - permeated by rest.  </p>

        <p>Author summary: The mythical structure of the Primeval History offers an image of God which seems at first glance to admit a God who repents his acts of formation and world ordering. Gen 2-4 describes, however, a dynamic God, moved, motivated and pushed by needs of human and world. God is changing by acting in a process-related way. Instead of an anthropomorphic notion of God (in the sense of &laquo;repentance&raquo; or &laquo;failing&raquo;), the narration presents God in an anthropo-praxis (&laquo;changing of mind&raquo;) pattern within a narrative function. </p>
<p>[Bauks&rsquo; idea is that in Gn 2-4 <strong>God changes his mind several times, to accommodate the choices made by men</strong>. While in the Mesopotamian parallel myths it is the gods who make decisions and change the course of the story (as is somewhat typical in polytheism, the gods are like copies of men), in Genesis it is men and women who do so. God is represented as completing his creation little by little (p. 333) and he thereby <strong>flexibly permits other freedoms to coexist with his own</strong>, and guarantee an order that can last in time.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;The view of ancient Israelite religion as monotheistic has long been traditional in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, religions that have elaborated in their own way the biblical image of a single male deity. But recent archaeological findings of texts and images from the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their neighbourhood offer a quite different impression. Two issues in particular raised by these are the existence of a female consort, <strong>Asherah</strong>, and the implication for monotheism; and the proliferation of pictorial representations that may contradict the biblical ban on images. Was the religion of ancient Israel really as the Bible would have us believe? This volume provides a comprehensive introduction to these issues, presenting the relevant inscriptions and discussing their possible impact for Israelite monotheism, the role of women in the cult, and biblical theology&raquo; (summary on <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/only-one-god-9781841271996/">Bloomsbury</a>).</p>
<p>[This book is noteworthy for the analysis of historical sources about the figure of the goddess Asherah, considered as a paredra of YHWH, a topic also discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;If one starts from the principle that the gods are many, the motivations for affirming that the gods of others are false gods or demons is removed. Within our societies, adopting the mental schemes proper to polytheism would certainly reduce the levels of conflict between the different monotheistic religions and their internal subdivisions.&raquo; 2000 years of monotheism have made us used to think that God cannot be but one, exclusive, true. On the contrary, ancient polytheism foresaw the possibility of making the gods of different cultures correspond to each other (the Greek Artemis to the Roman Diana, the Egyptian Isis to the Greek Athena), and thus welcome foreign gods into its own pantheon. This open position meant that the ancient world did not see the religious violence that has bloodied, and still bloodies, monotheistic cultures. Is it possible to draw on the resources of polytheism today in order to render easier and more serene the relationships between various religions? [Editor&rsquo;s summary]</p>

        <p>&laquo;This contribution discusses new hypotheses that attempt to explain the <strong>pre-exilic prophets’ of doom Utterances over Israel/Judah</strong> as literary fiction <em>ex eventu</em>. These approaches are based on external evidence of prophetic oracles which are known from royal archives in Mesopotamia, and whose content is different from the biblical texts with regard to addressing and form of transmission. An extrapolation of this evidence to ancient Near Eastern prophecy in general, would, however, be short-sighted &ndash; as is indicated by methodological considerations, as well as the Bileam text of <em>Tell Dēr ‘Allā</em>. A more precise interpretation already proves the latter as a kind of tradition literature (<em>Traditionsliteratur</em>) which reflects the concept of a prophecy of doom (not directed towards the king). In contrast to the discussed views this contribution argues that while, on the one hand, the assumption of a radical prophecy of doom in Judah after 587 B.C.E. lacks any evidence and inner plausibility there were, on the other hand, fundamental conceptual prerequisites for prophecies of doom (such as those of Amos or Isaiah) already present in the ancient Near East […]&raquo; (from author’s abstract on p. 81).</p>
<p>[The contribution is very helpful in re-defining the concept of prophecies <em>ex eventu</em> in ancient Israel, between reality and literary fiction, and offers a comparative approach with Mesopotamian prophecies.]</p>

        <p>The first part of this article deals with the four agents of divine wrath mentioned in connection with the Flood. They are enumerated in the Epic of Gilgamesh tablet XI:181-198, as lion, wolf, famine and the god Erra who personifies war, destruction and epidemic. They are suggested by Ea as a punitive option instead of the radical destruction that Enlil provoked by sending the Deluge. They are comparable to the four agents of divine wrath mentioned in Ezekiel 14:12-23: famine, evil beasts, sword, and pestilence. Ever since S. Daiches, scholars argued that Ezek. 14 reflects the influence of Gilg. XI. In the second part, the article analyses the phenomenon of indiscriminate slaughter of the just and the wicked in Ezekiel, or the innocent and the culprits in the Poem of Erra by the wrathful divinity that necessitates the presence of a watchman as a means of grace, so that a remnant may escape the slaughter and destruction. In the Poem of Erra, the role of the watchman against the indiscriminate slaughter by the god of war and destruction is assumed by Išum, Erra&rsquo;s lieutenant. Similarly, the tenebrous nature of the <strong>Yhwh&rsquo;s wrath and its unpredictable consequences</strong> represent some of the reasons why Ezekiel was appointed as a watchman. His task is to warn the people of Judah against Yhwh (Ezek 3:17; 33:7, &ldquo;Mortal, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, when you hear a word from my mouth, you must warn them against me!&rdquo;). A certain similarity exists between Išum the intercessor for the Babylonians who tries to placate Erra&rsquo;s wrath, and the prophet Ezekiel who attempts to appease Yhwh&rsquo;s anger against the people of Judah.

<p>Throughout the article, the author presents many texts from Ebla to better determine the exact meaning of the aforementioned elements, also providing a relative chronology as the examined terminology, thus investigating the <strong>diachronic development</strong> of the present ritual.</p>
<p>[This paper shows philological accuracy in the analysis of the original terminology (Sumerian and Akkadian) referring to specific cultic activities, priestly figures involved in rites, and peculiar offerings to the gods of the Eblaite pantheon.

        <p>&laquo;Our ancestors, the Mesopotamians, invented writing and with it a new way of looking at the world. In this collection of essays, the French scholar Jean Bottéro attempts to go back to the moment which marks the very beginning of history. To give the reader some sense of how Mesopotamian civilization has been mediated and interpreted in its transmission through time, Bottéro begins with an account of Assyriology, the discipline devoted to the ancient culture. This transmission, compounded with countless discoveries, would not have been possible without the surprising decipherment of the cuneiform writing system. Bottéro also focuses on divination in the ancient world, contending that certain modes of worship in Mesopotamia, in their application of causality and proof, prefigure the “scientific mind”.&raquo; (from <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3684684.html">editor’s webpage</a>).</p>
<p>[The author explains in this volume how a ‘scientific mind’, i.e., a mindset able to reflect and reason on the complexity of reality, did exist already in ancient Mesopotamia, before the advent of Greek philosophy. Bottéro exemplifies this assumption by analysing concrete phaenomena as they are mirrored in specific literary texts, such as divinatory documents, law codes, and wisdom text. In the end of such an analysis, it results that ancient Mesopotamians had a profound and complex capability of investigating and understanding many aspects of reality, showing a logical mind (although sometimes shadowed by religious thought) which can be considered as an antecedent of later Greek logic.

        <p>&laquo;In 2011, we launched new excavations and a re-analysis of one of the key sites for such early discoveries, the collapsed rock shelter of <strong>Abri Blanchard</strong>. In 2012, we discovered in situ a limestone slab engraved with a complex composition combining an aurochs and dozens of <strong>aligned punctuations</strong>. … The aligned punctuations find their counterparts at Chauvet, in the south German sites and on several other objects from Blanchard and surrounding Aurignacian sites. In sum, we argue that dispersing Aurignacian groups show a broad commonality in graphic expression against which a certain number of more regionalized characteristics stand out, a pattern that fits well with social geography models that focus on the material construction of identity at regional, group and individual levels&raquo; (from authors’ abstract).</p>

        <p>This paper (derived from a previous publication; see at this <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/Newsletter/12_2001/">link</a>) aims at rethinking the concept(s) of the term <strong>‘Bible(s)’</strong>, on the base of past or recent discoveries (e.g. the Cairo Geniza, the <a href="http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/">Oxyrhynchus papyri</a>, the Nag Hammadi corpus, other European and Middle Eastern manuscript collections, rabbinic and post-rabbinic citations, and the <a href="http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>).</p>
<p>In the <em>introduction</em>, some passages help in underlining the topic of the contribution: &laquo;&hellip;what we as moderns term ‘the Bible’ in actuality displays a wide variety of formats which feature conflicting tables of contents, different texts, variant forms of the ‘same’ texts, texts translated from diverse languages, and divergent arrangements of parts or groups of texts. These discrepancies are not minor and they make loose references to ‘the Bible’ unfortunate. Instead of ‘the Bible,’ there are ‘Bible(s),’ containing particular forms of certain texts in one or more specific arrangements used in individual communities. &hellip; Succinctly stated, ‘the Bible’ is not and furthermore never was&raquo; (p. 4).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 2</em> (the <em>pars destruens</em>) focuses on four basic statements:</p>
<p>1) &laquo;we can no longer speak of ‘the canon’ without extensive qualifications&raquo; (p. 5);</p>
<p>2) &laquo;under these circumstances we can no longer rely upon certain longstanding and usually unquestioned assumptions about the editorial structure, the contents, the date of final formulation, and the textual integrity of those literary works presently collected together under the rubric of ‘Bible’&raquo; (p. 8);</p>
<p>3) &laquo;we can no longer speak of the ‘final form’ of any particular text&raquo; (p. 10);</p>
<p>4) &laquo;we can no longer speak of ‘the Masoretic Text’ as the benchmark of Hebrew texts which best represents a pristine original form&raquo; (p. 11).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 3</em> (the <em>pars costruens</em>) presents four main assessments:</p>
<p>1) &laquo;while the term ‘the Bible’ without qualifiers may be confusing and clumsy, the adjective ‘biblical’ still proves useful as a classificatory tool&raquo; (p. 14);</p>
<p>2) &laquo;the history of ‘books’ in the Second Temple period in their diverse textual forms is qualitatively similar to the hypothesized earlier developments in the composition of biblical texts by classical source criticism&raquo; (p. 14);</p>
<p>3) &laquo;there is an urgent need for a thoroughgoing reassessment and revision of the current terminology used in the study of early Judaism’s rich literary traditions&raquo; (p. 15);</p>
<p>4) &laquo;reading any biblical book involves a choice of reading not ‘the text,’ but one particular form of the text, one which is merely a stage in the developmental history of an ancient scroll&raquo; (p. 17).</p>
<p>Here are the <em>conclusions</em>: &laquo;The discipline of biblical studies lives and thrives today as never before. That is so even though ‘the Bible’ does not exist, if by that we mean a canonically and textually defined entity held in common by all interpreters throughout the ages. There are only Bible(s), and they all include texts which exhibit a great deal of diversity in their family history. … Yet thanks to the remarkable modern-day retrieval of a representative assemblage of Second Temple writings that had been concealed within some caves near the Dead Sea, we now have a much more nuanced grasp of the intellectual and literary environments amidst which our earliest exemplars of texts, later to be called ‘Bible,’ were emerging&raquo; (pp. 17-18).</p>
<p>[This paper questinos the actual existence of a unique and definitive ‘canon’ for the Bible. Presenting many references to sources displaying texts of the Scripture outside the Masoretic ‘canon’, the author redefines the same definition of Bible, reaching the conclusion that it could be more appropriate to speak of ‘Bibles’. The analysis of the historical development to the definition of the Bible as it is known today provides the author’s idea with a solid critical background.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;The <em>Apocalypse of Abraham</em>, which has been preserved in old Slavonic literature, falls into two distinct parts …. The first part … consists of a Midrashic narrative based upon the legend of Abraham’s conversion from idolatry, which has several peculiar features. The second part … is purely apocalyptic in character, and contains a revelation made to Abraham about the future of his race, after his (temporary) ascent into the heavenly regions, under the guidance of the archangel Jaoel, who here seems to play the part of Metatron- Michael. It is based upon the account of Abraham’s trance-vision described in <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&amp;prq=15&amp;psq=1&amp;lvl=99&amp;pnt=tru&amp;acc=tru&amp;dia=tru&amp;enc=heb&amp;xml=fls">Genesis xv</a>. &ndash; a favourite theme for apocalyptic speculation&raquo; (from authors’ <em>Introduction</em>).</p>
<p>[This book re-interprets the account and description of Abraham’s conversion from idolatry, as interpreted in this late commentary to Genesis, probably composed between 70 and 150 AD but preserved only in a later Old Slavonic translation, whose dating is still debated.]</p>

        <p>This introduction to the volume <em>Storia delle religioni. I. L’Oriente e l’Europa nell’antichità. Tomo primo</em>, focuses on the definition of some basic aspects of the methodology behind a scientific <strong>comparative history comparison of religions</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 1</em> displays the basic question: “What is religion?”. The author stresses at the very beginning how the comparative history of religions, as many others, needs a deontological definition and a clear field of investigation, in this case, the term/concept of ‘religion(s)’. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em> moves to another question: “What is the history of religions?”. After a presentation of different opinions or definitions of this topic, the author concludes with a basic methodological statement: the only way to conduct a proper and effective history of religions is to consider and analyse any specific religion in its cultural and historical milieu. </p>
<p>[This contribution helps in defining the concept of ‘religion’ in ancient times, stressing how superimpositions of modern terminology can be misleading and must therefore be avoided in the historical and comparative analysis of ancient religious systems. The definition of ancient ‘religion’ is outlined by the author of the base on its actual manifestations and representations, a topic often discussed by G. Buccellati (see e.g. Chapter 4).]</p>

        <p>The date of publication (2007) can be seen from the printing indications on the last page. It is an edition of course notes written by the author for a class given in 1957-1958 at the University of Rome. In an appendix there is the Italian translation (by P. Xella) of an article by Brelich of the same title, published in 1960 in <em>Numen</em>.</p>
<p>The interest of this volume lies in the fact that the phenomenon of polytheism is studied from a phenomenological point of view, instead of describing one or more cultures, although there is a rich and interesting comparative section. The author underlines the fact that the phenomenon had not yet been studied in these terms (pp. 23, 136).</p>

        <p>There are many studies exploring the idea of <strong>innocent suffering</strong> and the concept of <strong>theodicy</strong> as it occurs in the literature of ancient Mesopotamia and Israel, but this is not the case with ancient Egyptian literature. This article explores the factors in Egyptian culture that led to the exclusion of theodicy and the idea of innocent suffering from their world view and literature. Bricker bases his analysis on van Soden&rsquo;s four criteria for theodicy: (1) a clear sense of right and wrong, so that a sufferer could reasonably claim to be suffering undeservedly; (2) significant individual worth, so that personal suffering must be justified; (3) minimal competition within the godhead or pantheon, so that suffering cannot be blamed on one deity due to human loyalty to another; and (4) a limited view of judgment in the afterlife. </p>
<p>He concludes that <strong>&ldquo;theodicy is not an appropriate category for discussion of Egyptian literature due to the Egyptian view of a judgement in post-mortem existence.&rdquo;</strong> Furthermore, &ldquo;in Egypt the gods are almost never questioned or blamed for injustices. &hellip; For the Egyptians, evil was generally associated with <em>isft</em>, &lsquo;disorder&rsquo;, the opposite of <em>ma&rsquo;at</em>. Those who did not do or speak according to the standards of <em>ma&rsquo;at</em> allowed disorder into their lives. For the Mesopotamians evil was often seen as a result of demonic activity, hence a result of living forces or beings. Even a &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; personal god may allow suffering to occur in an individual&rsquo;s life if offended, so the rituals in Mesopotamian worship often functioned as appeasement so that suffering was avoided or halted.&rdquo; </p>

        <p>&laquo;This volume represents a collection of contributions presented during the Third Annual University of Chicago Oriental Institute Seminar “<strong>Religion and Power</strong>: Divine Kingship in the Ancient World and Beyond,” held at the Oriental Institute, February 23-24, 2007. The purpose of this conference was to examine more closely concepts of kingship in various regions of the world and in different time periods. The study of kingship goes back to the roots of fields such as anthropology and religious studies, as well as Assyriology and Near Eastern archaeology. More recently, several conferences have been held on kingship, drawing on cross-cultural comparisons. Yet the question of the divinity of the king &ndash; the king as god &ndash; has never before been examined within the framework of a cross-cultural and multi-disciplinary conference. Some of the recent anthropological literature on kingship relegates this question of kings who deified themselves to the background or voices serious misgivings about the usefulness of the distinction between “divine” and “sacred” kings. Several contributors to this volume have pointed out the Western, Judeo-Christian background of our categories of the human and the divine. However, rather than abandoning the term “divine kingship” because of its loaded history it is more productive to examine the concept of divine kingship more closely from a new perspective in order to modify our understanding of this term and the phenomena associated with it&raquo; (summary on Oriental Institute’s <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/ois/ois-4-religion-and-power-divine-kingship-ancient-world-and-beyond">webpage</a>).</p>
<p>[The book offers an example of analysis of the relationship between political power and religious beliefs in different historical periods and various geographical areas, including also ancient Mesopotamia (chapters 3, 5, 7, and 14).]</p>

        <p>Brisch considers the phenomenon of deification of kings in ancient Mesopotamia &ldquo;a short-lived but nevertheless interesting phenomenon&rdquo;. In this article, she offers a short chronological overview of the most relevant chases from the third millennium BCE.</p>
<p>In the opening paragraphs, particularly interesting because they provide the author&rsquo;s methodological approach to this issue, Brisch investigates how the distinction between humans and god(s) could be perceived in a given cultural context - since divinity is indeed a concept that has been understood very differently throughout history and divine kingship has been adapted and creatively modified to each specific circumstance. As for ancient Mesopotamia, Brisch highlights a relevant inconsistency which may be often found in scholarly literature: «some scholars use the term &ldquo;divine kingship&rdquo; interchangeably with &ldquo;sacred kingship,&rdquo; whereas others make a clear distinction: one refers to the act of making a king into a god (although it is not always clear whether this refers to the deification of kings during their lifetimes or also after death), the other indicates the king’s closeness to the sacred but may not necessarily imply that a king was venerated as god.» (pp. 38-39). After having provided a useful review of bibliographical references on this topic, the author makes it clear that, in her article, with &ldquo;divine kingship&rdquo; she refers to the deification of kings during their lifetimes.</p>
<p>At the end of her review of case-studies of divinized kings in third-millennium BCE Mesopotamia, Brisch concludes that such phenomenon manifested itself very differently across cultures: in some cases kings were apparently deified (or deified themselves) shortly after overcoming a crisis or achieving extraordinary deeds), and in other cases deification seems to have been associated with political expansion.</p>

        <p>Written when Buber was 45, <em>I and Thou</em> explores human existence through the lens of three nouns, I, it, and Thou, which in Buber&rsquo;s view form <strong>two essential kinds of relationships</strong>. Buber asserts that the &laquo;I – it&raquo; relationship pertains to the world of things, techniques, power, objectivity, and the &laquo;I – Thou&raquo; relationship pertains to the world of persons. &laquo;The primary word I – Thou can only be spoken with the whole being. The primary word I – it can never be spoken with the whole being.&raquo; (p. 3)
Human life is twofold, and Buber clarifies that he does not mean to disparage the objective, &laquo;I – it&raquo; relationships that make up much of the life and activity of humans. But the &laquo;I&raquo; in relation to objects is not the same as the &laquo;I&raquo; that relates to persons. &laquo;When Thou is spoken, the speaker has no thing for his object.&raquo; (p. 4) Buber struggles with words in order to present a rich distinction between objects and the &laquo;mysticism of presence&raquo; of the &laquo;Thou&raquo;, and to insist upon the incommensurable value of a person. Famously, he wrote that &laquo;all real living is meeting&raquo;. 
Buber’s prophetic voice is attractive, but it is also limited by its lack of reference to sources and anchoring in history. It is a personal theory: interesting, sometimes poetically beautiful, sometimes penetrating in its description of the way we live. For a more in-depth analysis, see <a href=”https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buber/”>plato.stanford.edu</a>.

<p>&laquo;‘People of the country’ (<strong><em>‘m h’rṣ</em></strong> [؜הָאָֽרֶץ עַם]) is a technical expression of the Old Testament which has been explained in various ways, at least for the time before the exile. The most likely interpretation is the one proposed most recently by R. De [<em>sic</em>] Vaux, Les institutions de l’Ancien Testament I, Paris 1958, pp. 111-113, 326 ff. [available on <a href="https://archive.org/details/devauxrolandinstitucionesdelantiguotestamento/mode/2up">Archive.org</a> in Spanish translation], according to whom the term designates the free population of a state, the ‘citizens’, by right: see, among the most significant biblical examples, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9G.HTM"><em>2 Kings</em> 16, 15</a>; <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9N.HTM">23, 30</a>; <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9O.HTM">24, 14</a>; <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PPF.HTM"><em>Ger.</em> 1, 18</a>. This is the sense that is clearly evident also from an inscription of the king of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos">Byblos</a> Jehawmilk, datable to the 5<sup>th</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> cent. BC, and known since 1869, but integrated for the part that interests us only in 1950; we report lines 9-11 according to the reconstruction by A. Dupont-Sommer in ‘Sem.’ 3, 1950, pp. 35-44: ‘And may give / [to him (= to the king) the Sovereign, La]dy of Byblos favour to the eyes of the gods and <favour> to the eyes of the people of this country (<em>‘m ’rṣ z</em>)  [and favour to the eyes] of every king and every man!&raquo; (p. 77).</p>

<p>The basic question advanced by the author is the following: &laquo;What was the impact of the <strong>Bible</strong> on this evolution [i.e. the history of the faith of <strong>American Protestants</strong>]?&raquo; (p. 189).</p>
<p>The answer is that this impact was not so considerable, and the explanation is given under these respects: &laquo;Niebuhr thinks (pp. 172-76) that the prevalence of the first element, the objective criterion [of God’s Word], which occurred after moments of religious awakening, coincides with an institutionalist stiffening of the worst kind, against which today’s Protestantism must guard&raquo; (p. 190; English translation by mDP). </p>
<p>[This paper offers an example of how the interpretation of the Bible could (or could not) influence modern societies (in this case, American Protestantism).]</p>

        <p>The starting point for this contribution is the well-known passage of <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PBK.HTM"><em>2 Chr.</em> 36, 20-21</a>, recounting the deportation of the Jews from Jerusalem to Babylonia by Nebuchadnezzar II in 568 BC.</p>
<p>After having recalled two other Biblical passages relating to the same event (or to the same exile period), i.e. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PQF.HTM"><em>Jer.</em> 37-42</a>, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PQU.HTM">52</a>, and <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PBK.HTM"><em>2 Chr.</em> 36, 20-21</a>, the author summarizes the historical events of that period as they can be reconstructed on a quite stark floor, devoting the whole article to the presentation of the role of the Israelites remained at Jerusalem (or at least in Palestine) during the period of the exile (i.e. from the conquering of Jerusalem by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> in 568 BC to the ‘edict of liberation’, as it is inscribed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder">cylinder</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_I">Cyrus I</a> (text in <a href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/ANET_315-316.pdf"><em>ANET</em></a>), in 539 BC (for further information see at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity">link</a>).</p>
<p>The author sketches out the history of the period as it is narrated in some specific books written in Palestine in the 6<sup>th</sup> cent. BC, i.e. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PQV.HTM"><em>Lamentations</em></a>, and the prophetic books of <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PUK.HTM"><em>Haggai</em></a> and <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PUN.HTM"><em>Zecharia</em></a>, telling the events involving the ‘People of the country’ (<em>‘m h’rṣ</em>) (cf. for this term <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Buccellati1959BO3">Buccellati 1959 B O3</a>).</p>
<p>The author concludes: &laquo;The Lamentations give the testimony of the presence in Palestine (well in Jerusalem) of Israelites profoundly Yahwist and distinct from the group of Godolia: there is therefore reason to think that they remained in Palestine even after the turbulent period of the first months after the capture of Jerusalem and culminated in the killing of Godolia. The books of Haggai and Zechariah testify that the rebuilding of the temple, led by returnees from the exile, was the work of a population in which there is no trace of radical contrast between returnees and those left behind: indeed, from a tenuous but seemingly safe testimony, we can conclude that there was substantially collaboration. Without wondering to draw a direct line between the Israelites of Lamentations and the Palestinian Israelites of the time of Haggai and Zechariah &hellip; it is certain, however, that both groups are part of the same Yahwist tradition that continued on Palestinian land&raquo; (p. 290).</p>

        <p>This paper presents some reflections about the methodological approach in comparing texts of the Bible with the documentation of ancient Near East and Egypt.</p>
<p>On the occasion of a celebration in honour of Giovanni Rinaldi (promoter of the periodical <em>Bibbia e Oriente</em>), the author presents some remarks on the <strong>comparative method</strong>, considered by G. Rinaldi as &laquo;<em>one</em> exegetic method&raquo;, aiming at &laquo;grasping the spirit of the world in which the Bible is, so to speak, embodied … [to] acquire the sensitivity necessary to assimilate and enjoy its values&raquo; (p. 152). As scholars, our aim is &laquo;to recreate the historical conditions which facilitate the understanding of past events and institutions&raquo; (p. 152). This research of the ancient <em>Weltanschauung</em> leads the author to explain his view and method through three practical examples: a first comparison of the list of the tribes of Israel (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P5T.HTM"><em>Jos.</em> 15-19</a>) with a similar Sumerian list; a second comparison is presented offering in synopsis <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&amp;prq=104&amp;psq=1&amp;lvl=99&amp;pnt=tru&amp;acc=tru&amp;dia=tru&amp;enc=heb&amp;xml=fls"><em>Ps.</em> 104</a> and the text of the <em>Hymn to Aten</em>; the last comparison is offered displaying a passage from the New Testament (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P11Z.HTM"><em>Jms.</em> 5, 12</a>) with an Akkadian compendium of magical spells known as <em>shurpu</em>; see <em>Shurpu</em> II 6, in Reiner, E. 1958, <em>Shurpu. A Collection of Sumerian and Akkadian Incantations</em>, Graz, p. 13 (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Reiner1958Surpu">Reiner 1958 Surpu</a>); cf. also <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%201_mDP.htm"><em>Appendix 1</em></a> and <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%2015_mDP.htm"><em>Appendix 15</em></a>.</p>
<p>The relationships and communal features between the three examples are explained on p. 156: &laquo;The common denominator of all three examples is the fact that the texts are close enough to justify their comparison, but at the same time they are different enough to make the comparison mutually fruitful and clarifying&raquo;.</p>

        <p>The author presents in this paper a comparison between the two pericopes related to the <strong>Beatitudes</strong> (as recounted in the Gospels of Matthew <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PVE.HTM"><em>Mt.</em> 5, 3-12</a> and Luke <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWP.HTM"><em>Lk.</em> 6, 20-26</a>) and texts from the ancient Near East and Egypt.</p>
<p>After having recalled that the ‘genre’ of the beatitudes can be found also in the Old Testament, both in the ‘non-paradoxical’ and ‘paradoxical’ forms (the latter only in few instances, such as <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PEQ.HTM"><em>Job</em> 5, 17</a>), the author moves to retrace some ‘beatitudes-schemes’ also in Mesopotamian and Egyptian texts, underlying some previous studies which recognized a kind of ‘beatitude-scheme’ also in the Aristotelian concept of <strong>περιπέτεια (<em>peripéteia</em>)</strong> (see p. <a href="http://giorgiobuccellati.net/EL2/Buccellati_1972_Le_Beatitudini_sullo_sfondo_-_BeO_14.pdf#page=3">243</a>, notes 7-11 for bibliographical references). </p>
<p>After this statement, the author moves to analyse some Mesopotamian texts which could represent an antecedent to the evangelical Beatitudes: despite the difficulty in identify a specific <em>form</em> of Beatitudes, it is possible to envisage in Mesopotamian literature some texts presenting the same perspective of a regular changing of the lots in the life of specific human beings.</p>
<p>The first ‘genre’ of texts analysed by the author is that of the so-called <strong>prophecies</strong> or <strong>apocalypses</strong> of the Akkadian tradition. Another category of texts comparable to the Beatitudes is that of the <strong><em>omina</em></strong> presenting sentences in hypothetical form (“if A happens, thus B will happen”. The result of this comparison is stressed on p. 248: &laquo;The comparison between the Mesopotamian canon and the Beatitudes therefore has value not on the level of the collection as a single literary whole, that is, not on the level of literary forms and genres, rather on the level of the content proper to the individual clauses, isolated from their context&raquo; (English translation by mDP).</p>
<p>The author then presents (pp. 249-261) a synoptic view of the evangelic beatitudes with the texts of the aforementioned <em>omina</em> (also including in the analysis some Akkadian personal names), outlining several comparison dealing with eight specific topics: 1) poverty and humility, strength and weakness, ignorance; 2) weeping and suffering; 3) hunger and thirst; 4) justice (and binary opposition ‘light vs. darkness’); 5) mildness; 6) mercy; 7) purity of heart; 8) peace.</p>
<p>Here are the general conclusions: &laquo;(1) The form of the Beatitudes dates back to the Old Testament and is also found in ancient Egypt [for Mesopotamia see the observation above on p. <a href="http://giorgiobuccellati.net/EL2/Buccellati_1972_Le_Beatitudini_sullo_sfondo_-_BeO_14#page=255.pdf">255</a>]; this form, and its use in a non-paradoxical sense is therefore parenetic, probably refers to a cultic <em>Sitz im Leben</em>. (2) The paradoxical aspect of the Beatitudes (or at least most of them) can be explained basing on an influence by the wisdom tradition. Paradoxical indications are found in various points of this tradition; one of the most suitable documents for comparison is the Canon, which not only includes the same themes present in the Beatitudes, but also presents them in a codifying and programmatic form. The new elements of the Beatitudes are the messianic and eschatological ones&raquo; (pp. 263-264).</p>

        <p>This paper analyses a famous text of the Mesopotamian literature known as <strong>Babylonian Theodicy</strong>, which is close to the Biblical composition regarding Job. The author leads the reader through an analysis of the conceptual scheme of the composition, underlining the dialogic form of the text, involving a discussion between the suffering man (called by his interlocutor as <em>na’du ibru</em>, ‘honoured friend’) and a sage (called in Akkadian <em>āšišu</em>). </p>
<p>Several questions are presented by the ‘friend’, followed by an answer given by the ‘sage’. In general, the ‘sage’ answers question by question, revealing in sum that the only solution to fight all the aforementioned evils are two virtues: piety and humility, based on faith in gods’ willing. </p>
<p>Nevertheless (and that is the topic of the present contribution) the ‘friend’ stresses the apathy (‘abulia’) of the general people towards the suffering condition of the simple man (a topic that recalls many other wisdom composition, such as the aforementioned <em>Book of Job</em>, but also some Egyptian text, such as the <em>Dispute between a man and his Ba</em> (see <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SlW0CAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+ancient+Egyptian+soul&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20ancient%20Egyptian%20soul&amp;f=false">here</a> for a preview by J.P. Allen); the ‘sage’ provides the ‘friend’ with a theological explanation for such a human behaviour: the gods, indeed, creating mankind, gave to each man &laquo;as heredity forever not the truth, but the falseness&raquo; (p. 162), from the original Akkadian <em>sarrāti u lā kīnāti išrukūšu</em> (line 280).</p>
<p>On p. 163 the author offers a discussion about the compositive unity of the poem, presenting a first section of questions and answers, a turning point (an acme) of reflections on the human condition, and a third, conclusive, part where the ‘sage’ embeds the pains of his ‘friend’, communicating the universality of the human condition of suffering, underlining how the origins of all the evils is the apathy (or a lack in empathy [for this topic, see e.g. <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm">Buccellati, Kelly Buccellati 2014</a>]) of the humankind: the only possible solution is to trust gods’ good-willing.</p>
<p>An appendix (pp. 165-178) offers a formal and thematical analysis of the composition.</p>
<p>[The contribution displays an example of the comparative approach, presenting texts from the Bible, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian literature, all related to the topics of the ‘righteous sufferer’, theodicy, and human apathy towards the suffering of another man. Since men seem not to prove any empathy for the sorrow of another human being, the only solution against desperation is in the end faith in the impenetrable will of god(s).]</p>

        <p>The author begins with a presentation of the figure of Adapa, &laquo;summoned by Anu for having ‘broken the wing of the South wind’ (<em>ša Šūti kappaša ištebir</em>, 11 f.)&raquo; (p. 61). Adapa’s father, the god Ea, advises his son about to avoid Anu’s wrath. Adapa presents himself to Anu in mourning garb and the god become favourable to Adapa; nevertheless, Ea also advised his son not to accept deadly bread or water from Anu; however and unexpectedly, Anu offers to Adapa not the bread and water of death, but those of life; notwithstanding, Adapa remembers his father’s admonition and does not accept Anu’s gifts.</p>
<p>The author advances five explanations of Adapa’s refusal, and points out that whatever the explanation could be, this is the only Babylonian myth where the phenomenon of <strong>faith</strong> is present.  <br>
On pp. 64 ff., the author moves to compare the figure of Adapa with that Adam (see mostly <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P5.HTM"><em>Gen.</em> 3</a>): both Adapa and Adam &laquo;are faced with the prohibition of partake a certain food&raquo;; &laquo;the occasion to circumvent the prohibition coincides in both cases with a temptation coming from a third party, supernatural in character&raquo; (Ea and God); &laquo;both traditions present the culprit as summoned directly by god into his presence&raquo;; and &laquo;a specific similarity which remains to be stressed is the presumed ignorance of the events on the part of god&raquo;.</p>
<p>The author also stresses a basic difference between the two stories: &laquo;The main difference between Adapa and Adam is that the former remains obedient, whereas the latter betrays his trust. In this respect, Adapa calls to mind other Biblical figures&raquo;. Buccellati continues with a comparison between Adapa and heroes of other Mesopotamian stories, sketching the character of <strong>men of faith</strong>, facing specific “tests of faith”: Ut-napištim and Atram-ḫasīs, compared to Noah (see mostly <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P8.HTM"><em>Gen.</em> 6</a>-<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9.HTM">7</a>), but also displaying some differences, and with Abraham (see mostly <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PE.HTM"><em>Gen.</em> 12</a>).</p>
<p>Here are the conclusions: &laquo;Abraham too was called … to abandon his land and his home …; his response was given in the darkness and was based on faith toward the divine source of the command &ndash; and thus made him the prototype of the man of faith for a long and lasting religious tradition. … In Mesopotamia, on the other hand, the notion of faith remained much less pervasive than in the Biblical tradition. … They [i.e., all the aforementioned figures] reflect basic dimensions of a religious sensitivity which, though receiving its classical expression in the Biblical tradition, was not wholly alien from the surrounding ancient Near Eastern cultures&raquo; (pp. 65-66).  </p>
<p>[The author presents in this paper a comparison between Mesopotamian and Biblical figures, focusing on the topic of the ‘man of faith’, stressing a basic difference in personal sensitivity: while Biblical figures totally obey to the God’s will, the Mesopotamian ones are more forced by the gods to be persuaded to follow their orders, sometimes refusing to respect their commands.]</p>

        <p>The paper presents a description of the Mesopotamian pantheon as an ‘open’ and ‘closed’ system at the same time. This basic dichotomy is exemplified by means of some specific features of Mesopotamian wisdom literature (and also cultic practices), involving the topics of ‘fate’, ‘destiny’, ‘theodicy’, and ‘revelation’.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph II.A</em> (pp. 36-37) specifically focuses on <strong>religion</strong>, defined as &laquo;an institution which may be said, briefly, to regulate the relationship between man and the absolute. One pivotal point in this relationship is the very concept of the absolute&raquo; (p. 36). </p>
<p>In Mesopotamian thought, a dichotomy is emphasized, between an <strong>open system</strong>, the <strong>pantheon</strong> (&laquo;a kaleidoscopic repertoire of divinities who personify various aspects of reality&raquo;, p. 36), and a <strong>closed system</strong>, because &laquo;the corollary intrinsic in a polytheistic system is that the components of the system, the gods, <strong>place limits on each other</strong>&raquo; (p. 36). Under this respect, &laquo;we find in Mesopotamia, as a counterpart of the polytheistic system, a closed system which views the absolute as being above internal variation&raquo; (p. 36).</p>
<p>This dichotomy is clearly evident in the Mesopotamian concept of <strong>fate</strong>: &laquo;Fate is not a god because it is not the personification of any single aspect of reality&raquo; (p. 36); nevertheless, fate is embedded &laquo;for instance, in those myths where fate is presented as an object, the <strong>tablets of destiny</strong>&raquo; (p. 36). Fate is also involved in two aspects of Mesopotamian practices and concepts, i.e. those of <strong>divination</strong> and <strong>Theodicy</strong>: &laquo;Divination may be considered as the ritual pertaining to fate’s causality in human affairs. Similarly, we may say that some of the reflective literature, such as the Theodicy, may be viewed as the correlative of a mythological statement about fate. … the Theodicy is not the vindication of a given god or of the open polytheistic system, but rather a statement about the ultimate validity of the absolute&raquo; (p. 36).</p>
<p>Furthermore, &laquo;the texts which deal with the open polytheistic system propound an axiomatic view of the divine world. It can be compared to an <strong>immanent revelation</strong>, i.e. an obvious reality which makes itself known simply by being there. <strong>Transcendent revelation</strong> is not unknown, but is limited to the communication of specific messages, rather than being the <strong>self-revelation</strong> of the divine sphere … . Normally, therefore, knowledge of the <strong>divine world</strong> is simply assumed as obvious, without transcendent revelation and without theological reasoning: the <strong>metaphor</strong> is the main device to convey, present and describe what is already apparent. In contrast with this, we have texts [i.e., divination texts and <em>omina</em>] exhibiting a more inquisitive attitude-and these are the same texts which presuppose a closed system of the absolute&raquo; (p. 37).</p>

        <p>In this paper, the author suggests a cultic setting for the Sumerian story of the <em>Descent of Inanna</em> (p. 7).</p>
<p>In the first paragraph, the itinerary of Inanna’s journey is reported, describing the geographical framework of her peregrination towards Kutha, the residence of the Netherworld gods and her coming back to the city of Uruk. The author proposes to recognise a physical, geographical journey, starting from Uruk (through Larsa, Bad-Tibira, Umma, Zabalam, Adab, Nippur, Kish, and probably Akkad) and leading the goddess northwards to the city of Kutha, located to the north of Akkad (see <a href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/Images/Buccellati1982Descent.jpg">Map</a> on p. 4).</p>
<p>The second paragraph deals with the possible interpretation of such an itinerary as a <strong>cultic journey</strong> regarding the renewal of the goddess’ statue (following a suggestion by Paul Gaebelein).</p>
<p>Hence the conclusion: &laquo;Within these limitations, we may conjecture further on a possible <em>Sitz im Leben</em> for the assumed ritual. This may have been an annual renewal ceremony, which may have been a part of the regular, recurrent caring of the goddess, and might have originated in response to the breaking of a given statue, whether accidental or through enemy intervention&raquo; (p. 6).         </p>

        <p>The contribution traces the development of the <strong>perception of the absolute</strong> in ancient Mesopotamian culture. It posits that the encounter with the absolute can be fulfilled only through the self-consciousness of the human being, which is embedded in the elaboration of writing systems, at the base of any order and historical perception.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 1</em> deals with ‘a bond of <strong>solidarity</strong>’ (for which see also <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm">Buccellati 2014</a>), developing this concept by means of the so called ‘urban revolution’ or even by means of the previous, first agglomerations of men in groups (i.e., ‘villages’).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 2</em> describes how the first phenomenon led to the creation of a <strong>‘image of thought’</strong>, mostly throughout the means of the scripture which is the &laquo;visual image of the thought already embodied as word&raquo; (p. 116).</p>
<p>This thought led then (<em>Paragraph 3</em>) to the ‘perception of the absolute’: &laquo;The reification of thought throughout scripture corresponds to the reification of reality with polytheism&raquo; (p. 117). The best outcome of polytheism was this, indeed &laquo;to have detected the whole <em>coherence</em> of the data of the reality&raquo; (p. 118). The paragraph continues in sketching out the major differences of polytheism with monotheism (for which, see in detail pp. 119-120; cf. also <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm">Buccellati 2014</a>).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 4</em> investigates the relationship between the <strong>binomial ‘order and history’</strong>, the latter seen as an ‘organic evolution’, implying different developments all connected to a general ‘sense of order and coherence’ in human evolution.</p>

        <p>The present contribution, stemming from a conference given in November 2011 at the Catholic University of Milan, investigates the concept of the <strong>Trinitarian aspect</strong> within the theological, historical, and philosophical background of ancient Mesopotamian culture. This comparison may seem odd, and the author explains the reasons of such an enquiry under three points (pp. 29-30):</p>
<p>1) the <em>theological aspect</em> hidden behind the concept of Trinity is strictly linked to fundamental and universal characteristics of the human spirit: thus, any theological issue needs to face this peculiar conception of the divine sphere;</p>
<p>2) the <em>historical aspect</em> concerns Mesopotamia as the cradle where the Biblical tradition grew from: hence, Mesopotamia can be perceived as the background where the Biblical message partially shaped from;</p>
<p>3) the <em>philosophical aspect</em> involves the Mesopotamian religion as a kind of matrix (a ‘fossil’) expressing and representing our contemporary view on the world where our modern thought is still strictly informed by. </p>
<p>In the first part of the contribution [see <em>infra</em> for TOC], the author explains the diversity between <strong>polytheism</strong> and <strong>monotheism</strong> is much more complex that what we could think: polytheism expresses a richness in spirituality which must be understood in its own original nature.</p>
<p>In the second part of the paper, G. Buccellati investigates how the Mesopotamian religiosity led to a clear and mere <strong>perception of the absolute</strong> (cf. <a href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Buccellati2012a.pdf">Buccellati 2012</a>).</p>
<p>In the third section, the ‘Trinitarian implications’ of this Mesopotamian view are enlightened, dismantling any contraposition and underlining how this ‘non-conflictual dynamics’ led to a sublimation of the notion of ownership, reaching a connection with the notion of ‘gift and communion’.            </p>
<p>The author concludes: &laquo;The idea derived from Mesopotamia is therefore indicative of the fact that the <em>continuity</em> and <em>coherence</em> of human experience comes to our aid when we try to understand our reality today, to understand the motivation behind the altars still erected today to the unknown gods. … It is therefore up to us, if Christians, to reveal the nature of the desire behind the altar. It is a remote and perennial desire, and the study of aspirations and intuitions of the past must serve to galvanize our conscience as scholars and men. Bending over the factuality of the past and tracing its history must help us regain the vitality of the great clashes and spiritual confrontations found in it, and convey its deepest meaning, as well as when we try to discover the sense of an epochal transformation in the perception of the absolute&raquo; (pp. 47-48).</p>

<p>Chapter 3 deals with some aspects on these first community of hominids (around 30000 BP) who started elaborating some abstract concepts (in logical thought) related to time-calculation (the ability of observe and record on artefacts, the <strong>first calendars</strong>, the <strong>moon phases</strong>), the growing of an extra-somatic perspective, the elaboration of language as a base for the elaboration of writing systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, the last part of Chapter 4 particularly focuses on the so-called <strong>‘necromantic pit’</strong> discovered at <a href="http://urkesh.org/">Urkesh/Tell Mozan</a>, known as <strong><em>âbi</em></strong> in the Hurrian language.</p>

        <p>&laquo;It was in the Upper Palaeolithic, or late stone age (50,000 10,000 B.C.), that an articulate confrontation with <strong>time</strong> first became a reality. The general cultural context was that of <strong>art</strong> and <strong>language</strong>: they both show how humans could begin to relate to their own brain functions as reified items, through which perception acquired an existence of its own. But the most specific evidence of this wholly new mental process, and the one that is most directly linked to our topic, is found in documents from the same general period that offer explicit notations of time sequences on bone and stone. Building on this documentary evidence, and on that of the more complex <strong>calendrical and astronomical texts</strong> of early Mesopotamia, I will argue for a fundamental transformation in human mental templates that occurred in those early periods, templates that have remained with us ever since, with profound epistemic implications: the institutionalization of a <strong>scalar dimension</strong> in perception; the growth of a far-reaching sense of control, based on the predictability of recurrent patterns; the <strong>‘transcendentality’</strong> effect whereby the ‘invented’ time frame came to be seen as ontological time; the definition of a homeostatic system based on a totally self-referential evolutionary scheme. The coherence of time came to be seen as the coherence of the mental frame, the coherence of being as the coherence of thought. Against this background there emerged a contrasting proposal, one aiming for transcendence as opposed to transcendentality. It was the fragile biblical proposal, fragile in its inception because it was not nurtured by the same rich intellectual tradition of Mesopotamia, and fragile in its contextualization, because it remained obstinately consistent in adhering to an ontology that was intrinsically not derivative. The ‘view from Eden’ proposes therefore an altogether different conceptualization of time in terms of its beginning and its becoming. In this perspective, the <strong>coherence of time</strong> came to be seen as posited from outside the sequence, the coherence of being as independent from the overlaid categorization system. A radical new dimension was ushered in by Christianity. The ‘Christian’ notion of time is a true cultural novelty, that will come as a surprise that can best be appreciated against the background of the previous two ‘inventions’&raquo; (author’s abstract).</p>
<p>This paper describes the development of the <strong>perception of time</strong> and for the relationship between human beings and the <strong>absolute</strong>, conceived and assimilated in different cultures, throughout many millennia, on the basis of three subsequent steps:</p>
<p>1) the first step implies the development of a <em>‘meta-perception’</em>, strictly linked to language, which began in prehistorical times (ca. 60,000 years BP), culminating in the Mesopotamian culture in the 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC: this long-spanning period, defined as ‘tectonic age’ shows the development of human interaction with the outside world, between men themselves, reaching the utmost result in the ‘progress’ of <strong>language</strong> and later in the ‘invention’ of <strong>writing</strong>, a system that allowed men to ‘discover’ a sense of <strong>‘pattern’</strong> (constructed on <strong>’predictable mechanisms’</strong> which also affected the perception of time and the ‘dialogue’ with the <strong>absolute</strong>, thanks to a process of <strong>‘institutionalization’</strong>;</p>
<p>2) a further step was achieved with the <strong>biblical perception</strong> of <strong>transcendence</strong> (i.e. from a mere, empirical perception of something regulated by specific patterns and regular norms to the existence and presence of an absolute embedded <em>onto</em> time). While in previous Mesopotamian culture a kind of ‘homeostatic box’ implying a static dimension of the absolute (involving the main concept of <strong>fate</strong>), where &laquo;the gods are icons of elements of the natural order (power, knowledge, justice, etc.) that reflect the human ability to dissect and analyse&raquo; (p. 77). The biblical narrative provided men with a first novelty, introducing the concept of <strong>‘creation’</strong>, a &laquo;stark beginning, outside the box&raquo; that rests on what may be called the notion of an <strong>‘absolute event’</strong>.</p>
<p>3) the third step is represented by the <strong>Christian perception of time</strong>, moving from the simple notion of Genesis’ ‘beginning’ (ראשׁית, see <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&amp;prq=1&amp;pnt=tru&amp;acc=tru&amp;dia=tru&amp;enc=heb"><em>Gen.</em> 1, 1</a>), ‘inventing’ a new ‘Christian horizon’ involving the new concept of <strong>‘trans-temporality’</strong>: God manifests in time but exists beyond time, &laquo;a trans-temporal dimension to time that pertains directly to history while not being within it. … What Christianity proposes is, we might say, an <strong>‘apo-theosis’</strong>. While the initial invention had been the conceptualization of time, Christian thought announces its exact converse. Time, not as a concept, but as a perceived reality, is now seen as being wholly encased within a <strong>non-time dimension</strong>, the dimension called ‘eternity’. The term used for this is ‘the fullness of time’&raquo; (pp. 78-79). This novel view implies a <strong>‘reverse incarnation’</strong>, which is explained by, and entangled in the ‘event’ of the <strong>Ascension</strong> of Jesus: after this event, everything moves from an ‘absolute event’ (the creation) to a ‘relative absolute event’ which reshape the whole history as ‘trans-temporal’. </p>

        <p>In this article, the author examines &laquo;the evidence of material culture with the attendant degree of inference that seems plausible. The argument is relatively simple: on the basis of the formal attributes of an artifact as we have it today it is possible to establish formal patterns that imply a certain type of operational procedures; these in turn imply a sense of the whole that goes beyond the primary perception.&raquo;</p>
<p>From the observation of patterns of development in stone tools, the author infers the existence of patterns of ordered thought in prehistoric humans. The structure of the tools, the author suggests, can be seen as an example of the development of an ever-greater awareness of patterns in the world, and therefore of ever-greater control of the world. </p>

        <p>The author interprets the book of Job as a four-part text that follows the <strong>major divisions in the Tanakh</strong>: chapters 1-2 echo Genesis; 3-27 engages an &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; versus a &ldquo;prophetic&rdquo; view of history; 28-31 is related to the Wisdom literature; and the remainder of Job regards revelation understood as a mystical encounter with the living God. &ldquo;The adherence to the &lsquo;living&rsquo; God means precisely this: that the heavens narrate the glory of the creator, but that the ultimate goal is neither the construct (the heavens) nor the narration (the books), but rather the constructor and the narrator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This original interpretation develops a central intuition in Quando: that the major difference between <strong>polytheism and monotheism</strong> lies in the perception (in monotheism) of God as an &ldquo;affecting presence&rdquo;, unpredictable but personal, and with whom a relationship is possible. Indeed, this relationship is more important than any goods to be had from him, even in a state of terrible suffering.</p>
<p>In Buccellati&rsquo;s interpretation, Job can be seen as part of the trend toward the <strong>formation of a canon</strong>, since it treats the individual writings of the Tanakh as parts of a coherent whole. This is a further reason for seeing Job as emphasizing the single human confrontation with God, and the Tanakh as the result of a &ldquo;single inspiration, translated into a multitude of different stylistic embodiments&rdquo;. This would place the final redaction of Job in the &ldquo;prehistory of the canon&rdquo;, somewhere in the postexilic period.</p>
<p>In closing, Buccellati also proposes that the connection between <strong>Job and Ludlul</strong> be understood not merely because both texts deal with suffering, but because the main reason for this suffering is God&rsquo;s incomprehensible silence. There is perhaps a hint of movement (in Ludlul) toward a personal understanding of fate itself, &ldquo;the closest one gets, in Mesoptamian religion, to something that tends, at least, toward a &lsquo;mystical&rsquo; dimension&rdquo;; in Job, suffering leads to direct confrontation with the Creator. &ldquo;Creation is not really the final answer to Job&rsquo;s quest; rather, the <em>Creator</em> is the answer.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The focus of this contribution is firstly on the peculiar role of <a href="http://urkesh.org"><strong>Urkesh</strong></a> (from, at least, the third millennium BC) as a <strong>Hurrian religious centre</strong>. </p>
<p>After having completed the building of the Excavation House (<em>paragraph 1</em>), the <a href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> team (joined by some members of the <a href="http://www.orient-gesellschaft.de">DOG</a>) aimed in this season to better investigate and clarify the ethnic valence of Urkesh’s sacral and political spaces: the <strong>Temple Terrace</strong> (together with the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm"><strong><em>ābi</em></strong></a>) and the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm"><strong>Royal Palace</strong></a>, respectively (<em>paragraph 2</em>); the Temple Terrace, composed by the main High Temple (<a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm"><strong>Temple BA</strong></a> of Kumarbi and the vast open <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/JP/ugr/-frame.htm"><strong>Plaza JP</strong></a> were strictly linked to the Royal Palace and the <em>ābi</em>, with a progressive shifting of political importance from the temple to the palace, which was probably abandoned in a later time when a settlement (represented by private houses) developed on the top of the palace area.</p>
<p>Two aspects regarding <em>ābi</em> must be underlined: 1) the presence of some rituals similar to the <strong><em>kispum</em></strong> ceremony attested in Mesopotamian texts and 2) the attestation of practices of secondary burial. <em>Sub-paragraph 5.5</em> describes the stratigraphic sequence of the <em>ābi</em>, situated in area A14, along the southern wall of the service wing AK of the Royal Palace AP (see <a href="http://Urkesh/website/images/PALACE_SECTORS.jpg">Plan</a>) and interpreted as a necromantic structure introduced by an access equated to a <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0031651">KASKAL</a>.<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0032647">KUR</a>.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 7</em> offers new insights into Urkesh’s <strong>history</strong>: <em>sub-paragraph 7.1</em> focuses specifically on <strong>Temple BA</strong>, whose construction started in ED III.</p>

        <p>The <strong>monumental structures</strong> on the top of the mound of <a href="http://urkesh.org/"><strong>Urkesh/Tell Mozan</strong></a> are composed of a <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/J02/ugr/-frame.htm">stairway</a> (leading to <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm"><strong>temple BA</strong></a>), flanked by an <em>apron</em>, probably &laquo;serving to accommodate an audience that might witness the early phase of a <em>ritual</em>, starting in the <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/JP/ugr/-frame.htm">plaza</a> in front of the staircase and then leading up to the temple above&raquo; (p. 66).</p>
<p>The composite structure was abandoned around 1350 BC, with the coming of the Assyrians. Very likely, the cultic use of the area already started during the Late Chalcolithic and the sacrality of the place during the centuries can be argued from the absence of other installations in the area. The temple itself could be connected to a Hurrian origin, and the dedication of a first temple by king Tish-atal to Nergal (attested on the inscriptions on two copper alloy lion statuettes kept at the MET and the Louvre Museum) who can be better interpreted as Kumarbi, the polyad deity of the ancient site.</p>
<p>The other stone lion sculpture <a href="http://urkesh.org/EL-MZ/Mozan_3.pdf#page=220">B1.164</a> (for further bibliography, see <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/a65.htm">Urkesh/Search/Topical index</a>, under “Sculpture/Stone lion statue (B1.164)&rdquo;) found within the sacral area could have been placed near to the temple’s altar, while two smaller lion-shaped statuettes were place as a foundation deposit nearby the temple.</p>
<p>The paper focuses in the end on the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm"><strong>Royal Palace</strong></a> (slightly later than the temple, probably around 2250 BC) and on the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm"><strong><em>ābi</em></strong></a>, the <strong>necromantic pit</strong> leading to the Netherworld. Both the sacral area of the temple and the necromantic pit represent a ‘trait d’union’ between the living and the ancestors, defining &laquo;a very special Hurrian <strong>ideological landscape</strong>&raquo; (p. 69).</p>

        <p>The report of the 18<sup>th</sup> excavation season (2005) at <a href="http://urkesh.org/"><strong>Urkesh/Tell Mozan</strong></a> is entirely devoted to the description and interpretation of the <strong>Temple Terrace</strong>, with a reconsideration of the two lion statuettes of Tish-atal (see here, for an <a href="http://urkesh.org/urkeshpublic/temple.htm#structure">overview</a>].</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 1</em> described the Temple Terrace and the main goals of the season, aiming at better understanding the development of the temple (from the postulated, and later confirmed, idea of tracing back to the mid-fourth millennium BC the first foundation of <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm"><strong>temple BA</strong></a>), to gain an interpretation of the god who was worshipped therein (i.e. the polyad god Kumarbi). A history of the research is sketched, describing previous excavations on the High Mound (from 1984 to 2004), providing also the elevation of temple BA as 470.00 m on the sea-level (<em>sub-paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2</em>); <em>sub-paragraph 1.3</em> focuses on 2005 activities, while <em>sub-paragraph 1.4</em> investigates the development and the structural components of the Temple Terrace: the <strong>escarpment</strong>, the <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/JP/ugr/-frame.htm"><strong>Plaza JP</strong></a>, the <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/J05/ugr/-frame.htm"><strong>revetment wall J5</strong></a>, the <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/J02/ugr/-frame.htm"><strong>monumental access J2</strong></a>, the <strong>glacis</strong> and the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm">temple BA</a> itself (the present form attested at least from 2400 to 2350 BC, according to middle chronology).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 2</em> describes the stratigraphy: specifically, <em>sub-paragraph 2.9</em> describes the scattered occupation after the end of Urkesh as sacral center (ca. 1300 BC).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 3</em> focuses on other structures related to the Temple Terrace: the revetment wall, the packing and the glacis, and the escarpment.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 4</em> deals with the <strong>monumental staircase</strong>, presenting structural considerations, perceptual perspectives and projections, while <em>paragraph 5</em> focuses on the Plaza, considered as a sacred space. </p>
<p><em>Paragraph 6</em> displays major objects from the Mittanian strata, such as the clay figure of pig/boar’s snout, probably connected to <strong>ritual activities</strong> in the area (see <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/XVW/UNIT-TN/J03-q.htm">here</a> for pictures), ceramics from phase 1 strata, and Late Chalcolithic sherds. </p>
<p><em>Paragraph 7</em> discusses two hypotheses dealing with the two lion-shaped statuettes of Tish-atal (revisiting their provenance and dating) and with the equation at Urkesh of <strong>NERGAL=Kumarbi</strong>, retracing (<em>sub-paragraph 7.9</em>) the idea of an <strong>ideological landscapes</strong> of the temple mound. </p>
<p>[The authors attempt an interpretation of the function of different spaces on the basis of the archaeological evidence and the features of each structure; moreover, moving to the ideological perception of the sacred area, it is interesting to note how the location and physical features of the Temple mound hint to the building of an ideological landscape, affecting the mind of people living at Urkesh or in its neighbourhood.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;Sacrifice—ranging from the sacrifice of virgins to circumcision to giving up what is most valued—is essential to all religions. Could there be a natural, even biological, reason for these practices? Something that might explain why religions of so many different cultures share so many rituals and concepts? In this extraordinary book, one of the world’s leading authorities on ancient religions explores the possibility of natural religion—a religious sense and practice naturally proceeding from biological imperatives.</p>
<p>Because they lack later refinements, the earliest religions from the Near East, Israel, Greece, and Rome may tell us a great deal about the basic properties and dynamics of religion, and it is to these cultures that Walter Burkert looks for answers. His book takes us on an intellectual adventure that begins some 5,000 years ago and plunges us into a fascinating world of divine signs and omens, offerings and sacrifices, rituals and beliefs unmitigated by modern science and sophistication. Tracing parallels between animal behavior and human religious activity, Burkert suggests natural foundations for sacrifices and rituals of escape, for the concept of guilt and punishment, for the practice of gift exchange and the notion of a cosmic hierarchy, and for the development of a system of signs for negotiating with an uncertain environment. Again and again, he returns to the present to remind us that, for all our worldliness, we are not so far removed from the first Homo religiosus.&raquo; [Publisher&rsquo;s summary]</p>

        <p>Numbers 5 and 6 constitute an insertion of legal material into the account of the preparations for the march through the wilderness. Scholars have long since noted that the laws are united by their concern to prevent and eliminate sources of impurity. Many semantic and thematic links suggest that this section is a well structured composition, with the three main laws corresponding to the three <strong>purity laws</strong> mentioned at the beginning of the section (5.1-4). This article proposes to take this structure seriously, reading the law on restitution for wrongs (5.5-10) as a specification of the purity law concerning scale diseases, the suspected adulteress or <em>sotah</em> (5.11-26) as an amendment to the discharge regulation, and the law on the <em>nazir</em> (6.1-21) as a particular case of contact with a corpse. These connections shed light on the particular logic of these laws and point to the social function of purity laws, with each law defining the boundary separating each different group.

        <p>&laquo;Prayer, including praise as well as supplication, tends to be understood as the offering up of words that are enunciated and heard. However, prayer also has an important visual component, especially in the context of the temple, where ritual actions are a focus. The quintessential type of <strong>gesture associated with prayer</strong> in the ancient world was the lifting of the hands, a visual sign that accompanied verbal expressions of praise and entreaty&raquo; (from author’s incipit).</p>
<p>[This online paper offers some insights on the actual praying gestures in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia, underlining how prayer needs to be analysed in all its components, both textual and ritual aspects, with a specific focus of the ‘hand-lifting praying’ attitude.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;Jacques Cauvin has spent many years researching the beginnings of the Neolithic in the Near East, excavating key sites and developing new ideas to explain the hugely significant cultural, social and economic changes which transformed mobile hunter-gatherers into the first village societies and farmers in the world. In this book, first published in 2000, the synthesis of his mature understanding of the process beginning around 14,000 years ago challenges ecological and materialist interpretations, arguing for a quite different kind of understanding influenced by ideas of structuralist archaeologists and members of the French Annales school of historians. Defining the Neolithic Revolution as essentially a restructuring of the human mentality, expressed in terms of new religious ideas and symbols, the survey ends around nine thousand years ago, when the developed religious ideology, the social practice of village life and the economy of mixed farming had become established throughout the Near East and east Mediterranean, and spreading powerfully into Europe&raquo; (description on <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/it/academic/subjects/archaeology/ancient-near-east1/birth-gods-and-origins-agriculture?format=HB&amp;isbn=9780521651356#description">editor’s webpage</a>).</p>

        <p>&laquo;In ancient Mesopotamia, the divinity that chastises is not conceived as a sort of impassible judge who delivers sentences in a detached manner: the god punishes because the fault of man has provoked his anger.&raquo; (p. 1) Charpin supports this thesis with texts taken from four centuries at the beginning of the second millenium BCE in Aleppo. The first examples given are invocations of maledictions on enemies. They express the desire that, given certain conditions, the rage of the god be expressed toward a guilty party. A second group of examples regard situations in which divine rage is used to explain common events, especially sickness and sudden death. </p>
<p>A third example regards a text in which Addu of Kallassu asks the reigning king to give him what he asks, and threatens revenge if he does not. The text continues with a request from Addu of Aleppo, who simply asks that the king render justice to the people, and makes no counter-threat. To Charpin, this last, for the first time in recorded history, seems to presage a future in which justice for all is more important than the god&rsquo;s feelings of anger. </p>
<p>[Charpin and Buccellati are at odds regarding whether or not the god passes judgement on the basis of a pre-existing law or not. See <a href="/Mes-rel/Notes/08.htm#8.4">8.4</a>.]</p>

        <p>This dialog, about two-thirds conserved, develops a deep, and in a certain sense heartfelt, critique of polytheism. Three different positions are expressed, of which two are ideological (epicurean and stoic), while the third properly treats the <em>relationship</em> with the gods, and thus with religion as practice: this last is substantially agnostic. The author does not take a clear position, but leans toward the stoic ideology.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the third part, which refers the point of view of Aurelio Cotta, formally the most engaged in the practice of religion (as supreme priest), yet declares himself agnostic, to the point that he approvingly refers the use of the term &ldquo;atheist&rdquo; (the term explicitly appears in III 89). Cotta develops the argument according to which the intrinsic validity of the cult resides in the fact that it is a purely external form, socially valuable, but lacking any spiritual depth. This exposition seems to be coherent with the majority of sentiments in a polytheistic world, a substantially skeptical sentiment that indicates a deep crisis.</p>
<p>[The divorce between ideology and religion illustrates very well one of the main conclusions of my work, which is that spirituality (as an authentic form of ideology) must remain alive if one wants religion to maintain its vital reality. It also illustrates how religion can become an instrument of social control, which excludes the possibility for spirituality to have an influence on public life&ndash;which is a very present question in the contemporary world. Note how the first two interlocutors do not actually speak of religion, while the third (Cotta) speaks of the gods only in function of the formal practices of the cult.]</p>

        <p>Cicero presents many arguments in favor of his central thesis, that <strong>gods exist, care for humans, and provide indications about future events that can be discerned through various techniques</strong>. His major evidence lies in the observations collected over the course of many years in many different places, that in his opinion show underlying consistency and evidence that authentic predictions took place. A <strong>pattern</strong> develops in time. &laquo;If a sow should form the letter A on the ground with its snout, surely on that basis you couldn’t think that Ennius’ Andromache could be written by it?&raquo; (23) 
Cicero is careful to distinguish between knowledge of the fact that foreknowledge has occurred, and the possible causes of it. He does not investigate the latter, whereas he presents hundreds of examples of the former.
Divination is to be distinguished from other technical foreknowledge: &laquo;Doctors, pilots, and also farmers all sense many things in advance, but I call none of them ‘divination’&raquo; (111) 
Error is possible; &laquo;although many things deceive those who evidently divine the future by means of art or conjecture, nonetheless divination exists; but human beings can make mistakes in this art as in every other.&raquo; (123) </p>

        <p>&laquo;The last fifty years have seen a dramatic increase of interest in the <strong>wisdom literature of the Bible</strong>, as scholars have come to appreciate the subtlety and originality of Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes as well as of Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon. Interest has likewise grown in the wisdom literatures of the neighboring cultures of Canaan, Egypt, and especially <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>. To help readers understand the place of biblical wisdom within this broader context, including its originality and distinctiveness, this volume offers a rich collection of essays by distinguished Assyriologists and biblicists on the social, intellectual, and literary setting of Mesopotamian wisdom; on specific wisdom texts; and on key themes common to both Mesopotamian and biblical culture. Scholars, pastors, and laity will find these essays both fascinating and enriching.  Contributors to the volume include Paul-Alain Beaulieu, Richard J. Clifford, James L. Crenshaw, Edward Greenstein, Victor Avigdor Hurowitz, Karel van der Toorn, and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen&raquo; (editor’s presentation of the book on <a href="https://brill.com/view/title/12841">Brill webpage</a>).</p>

        <p>This volumes aims to investigate the many <strong>cultic calendars which were used throughout the ancient Near East during a 2500-year period</strong> (i.e. from the 3rd millennium BCE to the end of the 1st millennium BCE): it therefore discusses the structure of each calendar, the month names, and the associated annual and monthly festivals. The narrative is divided by epoch and by location, and it also offers indices of month names, deities, general terms, and selected subjects.
Cohen makes a clear distinction between different types of calendars: those which were &ldquo;parochial or native&rdquo;, i.e. observed within one city and its metropolitan area; ethnic calendars followed in territories that exceeded the boundaries of one single city or kingdom; and national calendars, defined as «mandated for use in all cities, including those previously using a parochial or ethnic calendar, comprising a ruler’s kingdom.» (p.2). Finally, Cohen mentions the existence of universal calendars, which transcended the borders of cities, kingdoms, and ethnic areas.
All the ancient Near Eastern calendars discussed in this volume were lunar, and Cohen discusses also the available evidence for intercalation, i.e. additional months which were used to synchronize the lunar calendar with the seasonal year. The author presents the rituals celebrated during each month under discussion: he provides information on the available primary sources, the scholarly research made for each festivals, and the information which may be gathered with regard to specific cultic acts, symbolism and religious significance. Also the <strong>political implications of the introduction and variation of religious calendars</strong>, the change of month names and the use of intercalation are thoroughly discussed.</p>

        <p>Cohen traces the evolution of the attitude towards <strong>divine retribution</strong> through its inception during the Sumerian civilization to its culmination amid the post-Kassite period, citing an increasing nihilism reflective of extensive socio-economic inequality. Through close readings and subsequent critiques of interpretations by four scholars, as well as an investigation into the socio-political climate of the Kassite/Post-Kassite period, <strong>Cohen wishes to debunk the notion that historical circumstances were the underlying impetus in the development of wisdom literature</strong>.</p>
<p>Thorkild Jacobsen likens the intellectual development of questioning the nature of the divine to the evolution of a child into adulthood. He suggests that at the earliest stage, man&rsquo;s relationship with the divine is like that of a child who sees its parents without flaw. Upon maturity, it realizes a growing deception, or more so, inability, for the gods to reign righteously - considering the unjust nature of society and retribution. Jacobsen rationalizes this development from an evolutionary perspective, a combination of the transition from communal to individual worship and historical realities. The despair inherent to wisdom texts is reflective of the Assyrian domination of the Near East, which saw an increasingly lawless, less civilized society. </p>
<p>W.G. Lambert cites the arrival and socialization of the Amorites as a factor in the emergent theology of the problem of theodicy. The rising intellectual nihilism reflected in literature during the Kassite period was circumstantial to the failing conditions of Babylon under Kassite rule. </p>
<p>Whether social conditions were reflected in religious doctrine was the concern of Rainer Albertz, who conflates ideology in the Book of Job with the Babylonian Theodicy. Transformations in religious ideology were congruous to a Post-Kassite weakening state during the Second Dynasty of Isin, which experienced many invasions and increasing economic instability. Albertz reconciled the newfound wealth of a rising neo-nobility with an increase in doubt towards the validity of the gods divine order, in his view most apparent in the Babylonian Theodicy. </p>
<p>Karel van der Toorn detects a shift in the psyche of Babylonia which manifested after the emergence of the &ldquo;nouveau riche&rdquo;. This new class of nobility caused a social rift which saw concepts of divine justice transform into the dualism of wicked and righteous. This social transformation birthed the nihilism apparent in the Babylonian Theodicy. However, van der Toorn also postulates the genesis of a &ldquo;counter-dogma&rdquo; evident in texts such as <em>Enmeduranki</em>. He suggests that this was a last-ditch attempt to aggrandize Mesopotamian wisdom, endowing it with ancient roots to increase its validity. </p>
<p>Cohen rebukes the evolutionary model of the development of social thought as reactionary, which he suggests is convenient and dismissive of complex phenomena. He broadens the definition of theodicy to include the sufferer&rsquo;s point of view as relevant and non-consequential. Historical and textual evidence is found to be insufficient for the supposition that social conditions influenced nihilistic attitudes. Cohen illustrates that <strong>Mesopotamian wisdom literature had a long-standing history of questioning the nature of the divine</strong>, suggesting the tradition to be inherent of Mesopotamian culture. The problem of Theodicy is far more complex than previous scholarship inferred and cannot be reduced to the response of a particular historical event or the fruit of social evolution.</p>
<p>The economic status and abandonment of urban centers during the First Dynasty of Babylon was not reflective of a failing state. Cohen suggests that due to a lack of textual evidence from the Kassite period, socio-political commentary is premature and speculative. Similarly, Post-Kassite Babylonia, although stricken with many afflictions, was not as disastrous as previous scholarship inferred. The negative outlook towards this period developed as a result of the emergence of a neo-nobility, explicitly mentioned in the Babylonian Theodicy, which gained wealth from land/entitlement grants and tax exemption. However, Brinkman warns that the inference of a weak state during the Kassite period, citing kudurrus as a source of information, is faulty and inconsistent with other known sources. Cohen argues the documentary evidence is insufficient to conclude that Babylonian society was in a state of despair following the collapse of the First Dynasty of Babylon through the Post-Kassite period, and thus the literature produced in that time-frame is not reflective of social transformations or theological reactions. </p>
<p>The questioning of philosophical tradition, divine retribution and nihilistic attitudes towards general social conditions has a long-standing history in Mesopotamia, in both Sumerian and Akkadian texts. This genre of literature co-existed with religious texts that expressed exaltation towards the gods and state. Cohen goes on to cite examples from Sumerian and Akkadian texts that exemplify the longevity of a philosophical tradition of examining the nature of divine retribution. He finds that <strong>what is perceived as nihilism by modern scholarship is actually an understanding by the ancient authors that the gods may have never been concerned with the behavior of people</strong>; they are exclusively driven by the promise of offerings. Thus the relationship one has with the divine is one of mutual concession. Even then, the fate of humanity is unpredictable, as is expressed in literature where a sufferer is plagued by misfortune despite being well-versed in the necessary rituals to expel it. The inferred nihilism is reflective of the inability to understand the actions of the gods. Cohen notes the scribal traditions of later periods were endowed with a rich corpus of ideas to build upon, and developed the critique of divine retribution as well as the condition of the sufferer more finely over time, thus concluding his argument.</p>
<p>A succinct overview of the perception of wisdom literature from past scholars. Cohen offers new insight into Mesopotamian literary tropes and their historical influences.</p>

        <p>Author’s summary: The present essay has come to challenge the idea that the Problem of <strong>Theodicy</strong> was introduced to Mesopotamian literature as a reaction to social or historical circumstances. First, support for historical or social catastrophic scenarios that allegedly promoted the rise of the critical discussion of divine retribution was denied. </p>
<p>It was demonstrated that the Kassite and Post-Kassite periods, considered at times the  &laquo;Middle Ages&raquo;, were not as dire as portrayed. Moreover, it was shown that these historical eras were reconstructed from the very sources they were supposed to have inspired, when literature was understood as a historical document in its narrowest sense. </p>
<p>Secondly, it was argued that with a growing and substantial corpus of works dating to the Old Babylonian and Post-Old Babylonian period, it is now possible to trace some of the ideas found in Kassite and Post-Kassite texts to older proverbs and wisdom compositions. The questioning of <strong>divine retribution</strong> by the <strong>Righteous Sufferer</strong> in a number of works, the realization of the incomprehensibility of the god(s)’s way, the reversibility of man’s fate, and the rejection of material wealth or goods, as part of a nihilistic trend, were all seen to be found, in one way or the other, in these early compositions. They all stem from the confrontation with the Problem of <strong>Theodicy</strong>, without any particular catastrophe looming in their background, either explicitly or implicitly, wishing to answer a question common to many religious systems, Why is there suffering in the world of the (innocent) believer. (p. 270)</p>
<p>[<strong>Cohen’s article examines and refutes the explanations of Thorkild Jacobsen, Wilfred Lambert, Rainer Albertz, and Karel van der Toorn</strong>. In his view, their theories about theodicy suffer from a lack of independent historical data, which relativizes or contradicts the assumptions upon which their explanations rest. Cohen therefore attempts to rectify the situtation with <strong>new data</strong> and arrives at the conclusion that the problem of Theodicy accompanied Babylonian religious reflection from its beginning, and did not arise in reaction to a cultural or economic shift, as claimed for instance by Nagy. &laquo;Questioning divine reward and punishment and the introduction of sceptical or critical attitudes are constant themes in Mesopotamian wisdom literature; hence an evolutionist historical scenario is not needed to explain their appearance and development.&raquo; (p. 245)
Cohen also expands the concept of theodicy to refer not only to a blameless sufferer (as Bricker proposed), but more broadly to the &laquo;attempt to explain in religious terms suffering or evil.&raquo; (p. 246) From the beginning, religious people have reflected on the <strong>failure of the principle of divine retribution</strong> to explain the actual situation of the world.]</p>

        <p>Cohen seeks to understand <strong>why texts specifically containing proverbial wisdom were utilized in the scribal tradition of Mesopotamia</strong>. Citing the persistence of the Sumerian Proverb Collection in the Old Babylonian scribal school and beyond, Cohen argues that specific themes were valued and integrated into the curriculum. Wisdom literature was not studied solely for the sake of linguistic practice but more so because the inherent themes had intellectual value. The existence of tablets containing texts of similar topics, &ldquo;compilation tablets&rdquo;, illustrate the value of the content. Cohen argues the presence of wisdom texts in Old Babylonian literary catalogues exemplifies their status as a distinct genre. An Akkadian-Hittite text, of which only the Hittite translation survives, emphasizes the cultural weight that the transmission of wisdom carried, suggesting that practitioners should memorize and observe wisdom literature. The value of wisdom texts was two-part - they were esteemed by the scribal tradition for their intellectual value and were permeated into the collective culture as a benefit for humanity. Cohen argues these qualities define the purpose of their authorship to great antiquity or divinity. </p>
<p>Upon examining literary inventories that seem to classify texts in accordance to genre, Cohen finds the <strong>Series of Sidu</strong>, a great sage of Nippur known for producing wisdom literature, present and cherished in the intellectual tradition and collection of scholarly texts. </p>
<p>Proverbs from the Series of Sidu were utilized in commentaries of omen texts seeking affirmations of efficacy, further illustrating the author&rsquo;s point that wisdom held high precedence in the Mesopotamian world. Thus, wisdom literature had multiple functions outside of literary and scribal traditions, it was also valued for its intellectual weight and instructional capacity for the betterment of mankind.</p>
<p>This article investigates the relationships between texts and scribal traditions, with a focus on the development of wisdom as a genre which held significant cultural value throughout the civilization&rsquo;s lifespan.</p>

        <p>This brief article summarises one of the main discoveries made the <a href="http://urkesh.org/"><strong>Urkesh/Tell Mozan</strong></a>’s team in 1999: a structure consisting of a circular chamber with a square antechamber (added later), a pit (at least six metres in depth, and five metres in diameter) found in an area of the exterior southern wall of the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm">Royal Palace</a>; the pit was probably covered by a vaulted ceiling, unfortunately not preserved. The structure can be dated around 2300 BC, existing already before the palace.</p>
<p>Then the quest for an interpretation of the structure started: a cist burial? A well? A place for making offerings to the dead? The filling of the pit helped in understanding the function of the structure: after having removed some layers of ashes, pebbles and seeds, remains of dozens of animals (including sixty pigs, twenty puppies, sixty sheep or goats and twenty donkeys), all butchered, were found. Furthermore, also copper/bronze pins and silver or lead rings were discovered alongside anthropomorphic vessels and clay animal figurines (see <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/XVW/UNIT-TN/J03-q.htm">here</a> for pictures). Faunal evidences attested in all the strata stand for long-time activities in the pit.</p>
<p>Archaeologists immediately linked these finds with Hittite-Hurrian sources describing offerings (usually made by the royal couple) to appease the gods of the <strong>Underworld</strong>, put inside a pit, and <strong>sacrifices</strong> of animals whose blood was poured in a pit. A question arises: &laquo;If the monumental structure at Urkesh was a channel to the Underworld, in which animals were sacrificed either for food or for purification to the chthonic powers, who used it? Who would have had a problem so serious that he would have undertaken an activity as dangerous as raising the inhabitants of the Underworld?&raquo; (p. 56). Eventually, the structure has been identified as an <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm"><strong><em>ābi</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>And this is a compelling answer: &laquo;The location of the structure at Urkesh adjacent to the royal palace suggests a similar royal use at this ancient Hurrian capital and the Buccellati’s believe that a platform situated between the structure and the palace may have connected them in a kind of ritual complex&raquo; (p. 56).</p>
<p>[The contribution is particularly relevant for the identification and functional use of the <em>ābi</em>, an underground structure uncovered at Urkesh/Tell Mozan, where necromantic practices connected to ancestor cult where performed.]</p>

        <p>This article stems from a preliminary preassumption: &laquo;kingship in Mesopotamia was always sacred, but only rarely divine&raquo; (p. 261). Cooper, then, tries to find answers to three research questions: what impelled some Mesopotamian kings of the third millennium BCE (Naram-Sin and Shulgi in particular) to break with the traditional model of kingship and become gods? How did divine kingship differ from traditional kingship? And why was divine kingship in Mesopotamia a fleeting phenomenon?</p>
<p>While discussing these issues, Cooper provides a review of the existing bibliography for this topic, taking into consideration both epigraphical and archaeological evidence. From his investigation of primary sources, Cooper comes to several conclusions: firstly, that the deification of a ruler was mostly purely ideological, and that it changed the practice of kingship little - if at all. A strong rule gained no additional power from his godship, nor was a weak ruler protected by it. Cooper also infers that a divinized king was no god but partook of the divine, and he remained human - but without many of the limitations typical of a human being.</p>
<p>He concludes that &laquo;since divine kingship cross-culturally seemes to be the exception rather than the rule, ther could well be some basic human cognitive resistance to pushing any living mortal fully into the category of the divine&raquo; (p. 264).</p>

<p>[With regards to G.

The author recognizes that later philosophical speculations on religious phaenomena were already present also in ‘pre-philosophical times’, specifically in the realm of <strong>mythological intuitions</strong>.]</p>

        <p>This paper surveys the onomastics of Babylonian women in the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods (from the end of the 8th century BC to the end of the 4th century BC). In the third section of the article (pp. 17-22), in particular, the authors analyze the recurrence of some particular theophoric elements, which allows for an assessment of the roles and statues of several Mesopotamian goddesses, such as Ba&rsquo;u, Mullissu, Ištar and Nanaya.</p>
<p>Cousin and Watai divide personal names into two main categories, rather than the three suggested by Buccellati in §14.2; their analysis, however, deepens rather than opposes Buccellati&rsquo;s reasoning. With regard to theophoric names in particular, the two authors offer an interesting social and cultural description of the use of divine names for women, also taking into consideration historical and political events which might have had an influence on the phenomenon of name-giving.</p>
<p>From this study of onomastics, they conclude that in the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon was still in force - even after the rising of Marduk, the tutelary god of Babylon, to the head of the pantheon during the Neo-Babylonian period. They identify a sort of antiquarianism which led to the use of theophoric elements like Ba&rsquo;u, which was common in the &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; pantheon.</p>

        <p>&laquo;The <strong>prayers of ancient Israel and Mesopotamia</strong> are rare windows into how ancient peoples interacted with their gods. Much work has already been done to describe how social conventions are important driving factors behind these interactions with deities. In order to utilize these observations and further understand the relationships between humans and gods, it is important to understand the ritual environment in which these relationships are created. A performance approach to ritual allows us to properly contextualize the <strong>human-divine relationships</strong> that are attested in prayers within their ritual
environments. In both Israel and Mesopotamia, actions within rituals take place in framed domains; because all social action occurs in framed domains as well, rituals can be profitably compared to other domains, such as theatre or sports. This dissertation uses a performance approach to analyze four different groups of prayers from the first-millennium BCE. Two groups of prayers are from Mesopotamia and are clustered around two rituals: the Akkadian <strong><em>šuilla</em></strong> and the <strong><em>dingiršadabba</em></strong>. The other two groups of prayers come from the <strong>Book of Psalms</strong>: the <strong>individual and communal laments</strong>&raquo; (from author’s abstract on pp. vi-vii).</p>
<p>[This thesis presents a comparative approach in the analysis of Mesopotamian and Israelite prayer, understood as a personal way to communicate with the divine sphere.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;Recently, while preparing for publication two new oracular texts from the archive of the Old Babylonian Kititum temple of Ishchali, I had occasion to review the literature dealing with ancient Mesopotamian prophetic texts and practices. Much of that literature focuses on the reports of prophetic activities found at Old Babylonian Mari and on the so-called “Akkadian prophecies.” Several much-discussed problems concern terminology: What terms should be used to describe the Mesopotamian texts? Do they reflect prophetic practice or an apocalyptic world-view, or are they merely the result of scholarly speculation? Are they native, or imported from the West? Beyond the basic problem of labelling the Mesopotamian sources and the phenomena they portray loom other questions: How do they relate to other Mesopotamian practices vis-a-vis communication with the divine? What are the connections between the various types of Mesopotamian texts that use the same or related materials? Even a cursory appraisal of the available literature shows the existence of a number of assumptions that on closer examination can be demonstrated to need modification or even to be altogether untenable. The material for the Mesopotamian side of the discussion includes both newly available texts and new interpretations&raquo; (from author’s <em>Introduction</em>, p. 127).</p>
<p>[This paper raises some fundamental questions about ‘Assyrian prophecies’, rediscussing some terms referring to oracular texts and questioning the possible connection between oracular texts and other Mesopotamian documents.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;The chronology of the ancient Near East (2000-1500 B.C.) is not well established. A much debated anchor point for this chronology is provided by a series of observed dates of the first appearance and the disappearance of the planet Venus during the reign of the Babylonian king Ammisaduqa. The Venus observations allow four different chronologies: Ammisaduqa year 1 = 1702 B.C. (the Long Chronology), 1646 and 1638 B.C. (the High and Low Middle Chronologies), and 1582 B.C. (the Short Chronology). In this paper we reanalyse the Venus observations using a physical model of the visibility of Venus in a twilight atmosphere. … The Santorini eruption serves as an important calibration point for the Aegean Late Bronze Age chronology (1700-1400 B.C.)&raquo; (from authors’ <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254913983_A_new_look_at_the_Venus_observations_of_Ammisaduqa_traces_of_the_Santorini_eruption_in_the_atmosphere_of_Babylon">abstract</a>).</p>

        <p>The stated goal of this article is to provide an introduction to the historical phenomenon of prophecy in the Ancient Levant and Old Babylonian Mari. It focuses on several topics, such as the terminology for prophetic personnel, prophecy as a system of communication, the link between prophecy and monarchy at Mari, and the question of biblical prophetic books and their relationship to prophetic practice. </p>
<p>The approach is comparative, similar to the one used by Buccellati in his volume, and the author surveys several ancient sources from both the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East (with a particular focus on the Old Babylonian archives of the 18th century BCE kingdom of Mari). Overall, Biblical and Mesopotamian sources are very well delineated and contextualized (§2). Additionally, Hebrew and Akkadian terminology are analysed in detail (§3). Also, the article offers throughtout a rich and updated bibliography on the topic of prophecy in the Bible and in Mari. </p>
<p>Deluty provides a useful analysis of two topics which are relevant also for Buccellati&rsquo;s discussion on prophetism: firstly, she discusses whether ancient prophecy could be considered as a sub-type of divination and, if so, if it should indeed be labeled as &ldquo;noninductive&rdquo; or &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; divination - extispicy being, instead, a sort of technical divination. Then, the author highlights an aspect which has often been underestimated by modern scholars: namely, the human intermediary who often stands between the prophet and the final recipient of the message. In investigating this issue, Deluty aims to offer a new perspective in the history of prophecy in the Ancient Levant and Old Babylonian Mari - revealing the human networks at play in the delivery of a divine message, a process which the author considers to be inextricably related to the practice of prophecy and to the central role of the prophet within ancient monarchies.</p>

        <p>While <strong>divine anger</strong> is a normal feature of mythological representations of the gods, and is present throughout the Hebrew Bible, it <strong>is remarkably absent from the Priestly narrative (Pg)</strong> as defined by de Pury (a detailed outline is provided in appendix to the article). The author notes that while the Deuteronomic narrative presents a relation between humans and YHWH that looks like a vassal-sovereign relation, the Pg narrative expresses a much more open dynamic: &laquo;In the narratives of Gen 1, 9, 17, or 23, one has the impression of the elaboration of an autonomously functioning system, a system which strives to leave each of the different partners their own dynamics, interests, and spontaneity, without measuring their behaviors by a pre-fixed standard. The divine word takes the form of an invitation rather than an order.&raquo; (p. 193)</p>
<p>The author briefly explains his reasons for accepting the <strong>Pg narrative as an autonomous document</strong>, and for believing that it was written in the window between 539 and 525 BC. His thesis fits the euphoric character of the beginning of the post-exilic period: <strong>God is not angry because he has no enemies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Creation is without enemies</strong>, there is no adversary in Gen 1 (de Pury criticizes the traditional reading in which the <strong>creator</strong> creates through the word: rather, in his view, the creator explains, defines, and announces with the word). 
Relations between humans and animals are admittedly violent. Pg is pragmatic: these relations are inevitable violent; the important thing is to preserve the long term coexistence of the inhabitants of the earth, and this is accomplished by returning the blood of the victim to the earth.</p>
<p>Relations between the nations, according to Pg, are essentially peaceful and inclusive. Only later, proposes de Pury, did further scribes add negative descriptions of other nations. The same is true of the <strong>Abraham</strong>’s family relations: in Pg, on the contrary of the canonical version of Gen 17, the whole land of Canaan is given to all the descendants of Terah, not only Abraham.  <strong>Only in relation to Pharaoh does de Pury see a somewhat less irenic situation</strong>; but even in relation to Egypt, the God of Pg acts with calm force, not with anger. </p>
<p>[De Pury’s observations support Buccellati’s emphasis on the <strong>radical difference</strong> between the polytheistic pantheon, which acts in anthropomorphic ways, and the absolute transcendence of the one god of Israel, who creates and saves with &laquo;calm force&raquo;. This is interesting, especially because the two scholars have a nearly opposite explanation of the origin of the biblical text. For Buccellati, the Mesopotamian material in the Bible, especially the Abraham story, is much more ancient than the exilic period.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;The subject of this article is the ancient Mesopotamian omen series dealing with the observation of malformed human and animal births (teratomancy) that is known in the field as <em>Šumma izbu</em> “If a malformed foetus”. We will concentrate on the “canonical version” of this composition, i.e. on the more or less stable form it took in the late second millennium BC and that is best attested in manuscripts from the library of Assurbanipal (669-630? BC) at Nineveh. Like other omen series of Mesopotamian origin, <em>Šumma izbu</em> consists of sequences of conditional clauses whose protases or antecedent describe a sign, in the case malformations on human and animal births, and whose apodoses or consequents give the pertinent prediction. The focus lies on a synchronic study of this text that aims at elucidating its internal structure, at establishing a typology of the protases, and at revealing the associative connections between protases and apodoses&raquo; (author’s introduction on p. 43).</p>

        <p>«Mesopotamia can be characterized as a “divination culture” more than any other ancient civilization. Because divination plays a pivotal role in the Mesopotamian belief system, understanding its hermeneutic apparatus becomes crucial to any study devoted to it. This two-volume book provides a comprehensive analysis of one of the most important divinatory compositions from ancient Mesopotamia, the series known in the field as <em>Šumma izbu</em> “If a malformed birth,” which deals mostly with malformed human and animal births.</p>
<p>The main part of the first volume elucidates the inner structure, the building principles and the hermeneutic code of <em>Šumma izbu</em>. The volume also provides a typological analysis of the textual sources used for the reconstruction and the study of the series and gives an overview over their chronological and archaeological distribution. Moreover, it surveys the structure and diachronic development of the Mesopotamian teratomantic corpus, from the Old Babylonian omen compendia to the so-called &lsquo;canonical&rsquo; series of the first millennium, and explores its social setting. An English summary of nineteen pages concludes the first volume of the book. The second volume offers a full edition of <em>Šumma izbu</em>, the first after Erle Leichty’s pioneering edition of 1970. This new score edition draws on a substantial number of unpublished sources, for the most part housed in the British Museum, and a collation of those already published. It represents a significant step forward in the reconstruction of the series. A detailed commentary discusses philological, lexicographical and interpretative issues and attempts at contextualizing Šumma izbu within the ancient Mesopotamian divinatory corpus»(Author&rsquo;s abstract).</p>

        <p>The author discusses dedicatory inscriptions as examples of communication with the divine. The paper argues that divinatory inscriptions communicate with the god(s) not only by means of the written message they carry, but also by means of their very existence: the materiality and presence in the sanctuary, close to the divine presence.</p>
<p>The author considers divinatory inscriptions as forms of both &ldquo;vertical communication&rdquo; (i.e., with the divine, based on the assumption that deities dwell in heaven) and &ldquo;horizontal communication&rdquo; (i.e., with the surrounding society), and uses the dedicatory inscriptions which were found in the Yahwistic sanctuary from the Persian and Hellenistic Period excavated on Mount Gerizim (Nablus) as a case-study.</p>
<p>The authors also consider the function of dedicatory inscription as a proxy for its donor: as such, the inscription becomes the eternal presence which allows for a perpetual display of the giver&rsquo;s ritual participation and devotion.</p>

<p>A NMI (‘minimal number of individuals’) ratio was calculated, the results being displayed in tables 2-3, on p. 70. Traces of <strong>butchering</strong> and the presence of some specific bones of the animal could hint to a <strong>deliberate selection</strong> of some anatomical parts for <strong>ritual purposes</strong> (considering the peculiar emplacement of the items). </p>
<p>Some animals were bred for practical goals (to obtain meat, milk, wool or for working force) or for specific intents (such as the dogs, probably used in <strong>sacrifices</strong>). </p>
<p>The osteometrical study of the bones can also provide us with information about the age of death and the actual size of the various animals (for specific details, see tables on pp. 77-79).         </p>

        <p>While investigating the corpus of texts which may be considered as part of the &ldquo;Near Eastern laws&rdquo;, Doak starts from the assumption that &ldquo;the search for a comprehensive logic or rationale behind the desire to ensure social justice in the ancient Near East is destined to fall short of the goal&rdquo; (§II). He observes that there was no Aristotelian logic in the ancient Mesopotamian juridical concept, nor were abstract ideas such as &ldquo;equality&rdquo; or &ldquo;justice&rdquo; ever defined in the Mesopotamian lexicon. Likewise, there was no such a thing as a Near Eastern treatise on the subject of fairness or social justice.</p>
<p>Doak analyzes many Near Eastern legal texts, including the <em>Code of Ur-Nammu</em>, the inscriptions related to juridical reforms left by Lipit-Ishtar, the <em>Code of Hammurabi</em>, and the &ldquo;social reforms&rdquo; promoted by Uruinimgina/Urukagina - looking for their social and cultural background and significance in terms of justice and the law. The role of kings and judges is investigated, considering each case in its peculiar chronological context. The author also describes, by making use of written sources beginning with the <em>Hymn to Shamash</em> (Buccellati&rsquo;s text App. 3), how Shamash/UTU came to be the main ancient Mesopotamians god who embodied the ideals of - and looked after - social justice.</p>
<p>Also the connection between writing and orality of law in the ancient Near Eastern social context is considered: Doak suggests that the relationship between &ldquo;formal law&rdquo; and practice was fluid and allowed for some sort of flexibility to meet local needs, though in many cases probably at the expense of consistency. Ancient Mesopotamian legal context, thus, was not characterized by that sense of anonymity and objectivity that is associated with modern legal systems.</p>

        <p>Durand&rsquo;s wide ranging text principally examines the creation myth involving the <strong>mythologem of a battle</strong> between Marduk (storm-god) and Tiamat (goddess of the sea). On the basis of ARMT XXVI/3, he proposes that this <strong>theme existed already in 1800 BC</strong>, in an area far from Babylon. He also believes it is found in an Akkadian myth involving a battle between Tispak and the sea, dating a millenium earlier than Marduk. This myth could have influenced the culture of Ugarit, and from there it could have influenced Babylon. This conclusion responds to the question posed by (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Jacobsen1968Battle">Jacobsen 1968 Battle</a>): <strong>the mythologem could have traveled from west to east, from Ugarit to Babylon</strong>.</p>
<p>Durand notes that the mythologem is known not from a literary text, but from a foundational text for Amorite royalty, and expects that something similar will one day be found in a text from Babylon proper. The victory of Ba&rsquo;al over the sea preluded to his building a palace and taking the throne, and his weapons are sent to the king in order to begin a sacred ceremony. In the same way that the god of order triumphed over the goddess of chaos, so the king must bring about justice in his potentially chaotic realm. These and other reasons lead Durand to propose that &ldquo;l&rsquo;accession de Marduk à la qualité de dieu d&rsquo;Empire s&rsquo;est passée par une adéquation progressive à l&rsquo;image radieuse d&rsquo;Addu d&rsquo;Alep&rdquo;. </p>

        <p>Durand offers a close examination of the words indicating <strong>fault, sin, regret, and repentance</strong>. He begins by noting that action was essentially referred to humans, as the gods spent their eternity asleep (if possible). &laquo;All lack and all error had to be first of all, or rather uniquely, on the part of humans.&raquo; (p. 377).</p>
<p>His basic criterion for discerning the original meaning of words is a &laquo;translation in the negative&raquo;, of which he offers three examples. For instance, rather than &laquo;make peace&raquo;, the word <em>salamum</em> means to &laquo;not kill each other&raquo;. This criterion is then applied in determining the Babylonian concept of sin, which is first of all &laquo;material loss&raquo; in Durand’s estimation. A word often rendered as moral fault, <em>arnum</em>, should be understood primitively as a &laquo;stain&raquo; caused by contact with a sacred object.</p>
<p>The words indicating the consequences of an immoral act carry the sense of being the immediate consequence of the action: &laquo;committing a sin immediately involves punishment&raquo; (p. 385). However, the &laquo;sinner&raquo; does not necessarily intend to not commit the same action again. He may wish to avoid the bad consequences, but the actions are not understood as moral or immoral in themselves. </p>
<p>Durand concludes that the translation &laquo;sin&raquo; of Mesopotamian words is erroneous, and causes a misleading and fruitless search for a corresponding category of &laquo;repentance&raquo;. Before the Christian era, &laquo;if people were afraid&hellip;of the consequences of an act, they consecrated all their energy to annul those consequences; they never pose the question of never doing it again. Their acts… are measured by their consequences, not in themselves. A successful action is, by this fact, judged good.&raquo; (p. 388)</p>

        <p>The volume collects twenty-one papers which were presented at the Interdisciplinary Colloquium organized by the “Chaire Milieux Bibliques” at the Collège de France in Paris, in 2012. The aim of the conference was to investigate the intrinsic need of every human society of disciplining itself by means of various taboos. Such discipline entails several possible transgressions, which inevitably lead to sanctions: all these aspects are discussed in the volume.</p>
<p>The approach used in the volume is interdisciplinary and comparatist: four main topics are discussed by the authors - 1. linguistic issues and terms used to express the concept of “interdiction”; 2. the economic and social context in which different
ideas of taboos arose, or sanctions were conceived; 3. contact taboos, including sexual regulations; 4. food taboos and table matters.</p>
<p>Overall, this book offers several causes for reflection. The most evident one is <strong>the clear absence of a specific term or phrase used by members of ancient societies to express the equivalent of the modern word “taboo”</strong>. Durand’s analysis of the Mesopotamian corpus, Démare-Lafont’s new interpretation of the expression “to eat a taboo” in a legal text dating to the Third Dinasty of Ur, as well as Erbele-Küster’s analysis of the term <em>niddâ</em> as it appears in the Leviticus: these three papers prove that “taboo” and “transgression” were flexible and dynamic categories. This holds true particularly for the Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures, while in Israel interdictions have been more clearly defined through the words written in the Bible.</p>

        <p>&laquo;Professor Eliade states that the aim of the book is to deal &ldquo;with a twofold problem: first, what is religion and, secondly, how far can one talk of the history of religion?&rdquo; (p. xii). In regard to the first of these problems, dispensing with any a priori definition of religious phenomena, the author, with great erudition and drawing upon innumerable examples from widely different cultures and varying levels of religious experience, attempts the examination of various &ldquo;hierophanies&rdquo;, or manifestations of the sacred. Beginning with hierophanies at different cosmic levels, - sky, waters, earth, stones - he goes on to consider biological hierophanies - the rhythm of the moon, the sun, vegetation and agriculture, sexuality - and then to local hierophanies - consecrated places, temples - and finally, in two interesting chapters, he discusses the significance of myths and symbols. As to how far we can talk of the history of religion, Professor Eliade hardly comes to grips with the problem at all, but suggests that this subject will be dealt with later in a companion volume.&raquo; (From a review by D. Howard Smith, 1959)</p>

From such analysis, it may be inferred that not only there was a considerable awareness of the importance of the religious calendar and the observance of festivals in the proper days, but also that the control of timing was so developed that it was even incorporated into the semantics of the royal propaganda. Among the many powers that a Neo-Assyrian king could boast, thus, there was also the one of ruling over time.
At first, the article refers to some specific characteristics of the Assyrian calendar of the first millennium BC, introducing the individuals who were involved in the determination of the days and months and discussing the system that was in use. Then, it discusses how calendrical issues were used in the Neo-Assyrian royal propaganda to convey the idea of a universal central power. Finally, the article presents an updated cultic calendar for the period under investigation.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the topic of divine repentance in Near Eastern literary sources, offering a comparative analysis of texts stemming from Mesopotamia and Israel. While doing this, the author also investigates the theme of divine anthropopatism, its religious implications and the role of repentance in the story of the Flood, in Mesopotamia and in the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p>The subject of God&rsquo;s repentance in the Hebrew Bible has been discussed several times by scholars in light of its profound theological implications, but this topic did not raise a similar interest in scholars of the ancient Mesopotamia. This may be due primarily to the lack of Sumerian or Akkadian words that could express the concepts of repentance and/or remorse. An analysis of the accounts of the Flood as reported in <em>When Gods Were Men</em> and <em>Genesis</em> 6-9, however, shows that both these narratives refer more or less explicitly to the presence of divine repentance: the different rendering finds its justification in the cultural milieu within which these texts were written, in the different way to express feelings and emotions according to a very specific lexicon, and in the contrasting perception of man&rsquo;s relationship with the supernatural.</p>
<p>Indeed, despite being described in the available original written sources in unequivocal anthropomorphic and anthropopathic terms, Mesopotamian gods do not (or, better said, they cannot) repent. Conversely, YHWH does repent - and he does so more than once, according to the Hebrew Bible. The main reason for these different attitudes should be detected in the fact that Near Eastern gods do not love their human creatures nor do they feel any emotional attachment towards humankind; on the contrary, YHWH is profoundly and directly involved in the destiny of humanity and deeply concerned by the way humans live. </p>

        <p>This article investigates the relationship between men and gods in first millennium BCE Assyria within the specific realm of cultic commensality, which is considered to be a particularly significant and expressive moment of such relationship. In this perspective, ceremonial banquets were the physical tool through which direct contact with the supernal world was possible.</p>
<p>At first, daily meals consumed in Assyrian temples are described, with their main phases and specific human agents who performed well-defined task in well-defined moments. Once the food had been set on the tables placed in front of the divine statues, it assumed a special nature: its consumption normally took place in the innermost areas of temples, at the presence of only the gods themselves. Cases in which a few privileged men (usually the king alone) could share the same food and drinks with the deities were indeed extremely rare. However, even in these cases it was not a true act of sharing food: men ate their meal in the courtyard of the shrines, along with the gods - who simultaneously consumed their food a few meters away, in the privacy of their private apartments.</p>
<p>At pp. 322-326, one specific issue is addressed: &ldquo;How did gods eat?&rdquo;. There is no Neo-Assyrian source - nor any written text from any other period of the entire Mesopotamian history - that provides an answer about how gods could effectively eat their meals. This question was raised also in ancient times, as the account of the &ldquo;Bel and the Dragon&rdquo; (in the 14th chapter of the Biblical book of Daniel) testifies. Gods partook of meals through the physical presence of their icons and statues, which underwent two specific rituals designated as &ldquo;mouth-washing&rdquo; and &ldquo;mouth-opening&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is stated that the focus of the entire sacred meals in ancient Near Eastern cultures was actually on the favourable receiving of the offerings presented to the gods by their devotees: indeed, there was no need to hide the fact that the food did not actually &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; into the stomachs of the deities. The very fact that food was accepted triggered a series of causes and effects which, ultimately, had tangible and positive outcomes for those who performed the rituals.</p>

        <p>This article sets out to investigate the essence and purpose of prohibitions concerning meat in first millennium Mesopotamian society. Among the edible substances, meat has been considered throughout human history as a supreme food, the core around which the main meals and feasts can and should be arranged - meat, however, is also the most likely target of vetoes and regulations, when compared with other edible substances. The article at first considers the Sumerian and Akkadian words referring to interdictions and their relevance in the realm of dietary regulation, and then presents the texts dated to the first millennium BCE that provide the most useful information on the relationship between Mesopotamian people and meat, with a particular reference to its ban. Then, it discusses in detail the types of prohibited animals and the particular circumstances in which vetoes were observed. Finally, the consequences of the infringement of dietary proscriptions are discussed, together with the countermeasures taken in order to appease the gods and regain a pure status.</p>
<p>In first-millennium BCE Mesopotamia, dietary rules seem to have been effective almost exclusively in a religious context, and even more so, for special rites or religious performances. The observance of rules, including the dietary ones, was crucial for positive maintenance of the mutual relations between worshippers and deities. Indeed, purity in ancient Assyria was not an absolute concept, but it depended on the time of the year and the specific circumstance. In particular, meat prohibitions were a transitory reality: there were no permanent, unchangeable food regulations which remained valid across the Near East, but rather multiple well-defined, temporary prohibitions which targeted different members of the society in different social contexts.</p>

A survey of the data on the origin of religion, that leads to the conclusion that the religious sense derives from the very beginnings of humanization (p. 210). In particular, the author develops (pp. 185-189; 213-217) the argument in support of a variety of symbolisms that demonstrate the existence of a &ldquo;universe of values&rdquo;: functional symbolism (symmetry in the production of bifacials, the domestication of fire, etc.), social symbolism (linguistic communication &laquo;since the most ancient phase of humanity&raquo;), spiritual symbolism (funerary practices and art).</p>
<p>[The notion of a &ldquo;functional symbolism&rdquo; seems particularly useful, but the consequences that the author draws (see also the chapter &laquo;Origins and development of human language&raquo;, on pp. 109-119) seem excessive, in that they are not sufficiently attentive, in my opinion, to the central role of articulate language and the substantial difference between it and embryonic forms of proto-language, on which see D. Bickerton.)</p>

        <p>Eliade often &laquo;gives the impression of positing the existence of something non-temporal, eternal, existent &lsquo;in itself&rsquo;, independently of the experience that humans can have of it&raquo;, which is a &laquo;solipsistic proposal&raquo; (p. 366). It follows that this type of research belongs &laquo;less to the history of religions than to the study of the Imaginary&raquo; (p. 367). In other words, there is &laquo;an underlying ontology&raquo; (p. 368), which follows a concept of &laquo;Nature&hellip; which&hellip; evokes most of all the traces of a rural imagination, especially from Central Europe&raquo; (p. 369).</p>

        <p>In this article, S. Fink investigates three literary documents that might reveal a measure of intellectual opposition in ancient Mesopotamia. The scholar first analyzes <em>The Instructions of Shupe-ameli</em>: a dialogue between a father and a son in which the latter questions the established customs and values of his father by a radical way of seeing all these deeds in the light of the inevitability of death. The second poem to be investigated is <em>The Babylonian Theodicy</em> - a text which is also written in a dialogic form, and that investigates the question of suffering (usually explained by the causal relationship of sin and sanction), and that of the existence of a just world order by ultimately questioning the justice of the gods. Finally, Fink analyzes <em>The Dialogue of Pessimism</em> - once again a dialogue, this time between a master and his slave.</p>
<p>Fink&rsquo;s conclusion is that these three texts reveal that at least by the first millennium BCE, there was in Mesopotamia a group of people who argued against the rules of behaviour and the traditional values established by society. Such poems «demonstrate that there were doubts about the justice of the gods and the king. This implies that people were searching for something else or at least seemed not to be confident with the way things were organized by the state. They did not believe in an overall justice anymore.» (p. 177).</p>

        <p>The authors suggest that a linear trajectory towards inequality accompanied the advent of <strong>temples</strong> as they evolved from smaller &ldquo;ritual houses&rdquo;, implying that societal growth and development laid the foundation for <strong>hierarchical</strong> injustice. This chapter seeks to investigate whether <strong>inequality</strong> can be detected through <strong>archaeology</strong>. &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; child burials, a trade economy of luxury goods, and evidence of deliberate burning of residences linked with nobility all suggest the growing presence of socio-economic division. The chapter is divided by focus between <strong>Northern</strong> and <strong>Southern Mesopotamia</strong>, recognizing societal differences between regions and attributing that to rainfall and proximity to river systems. It is argued that the growth of <strong>agricultural industries</strong> saw an increase in the division of labor ultimately leading to the extension of familial units. Development of defensive boundaries at sites such as <strong>Tell es-Sawwan</strong> and <strong>Tell Hassuna</strong> illustrate heightened tensions. <strong>Halaf ware</strong> pottery types are investigated with respect to long-distance trade and within their archaeological provenience to suggest patterns of <strong>social inequality</strong>. Case studies of <strong>Tepe Gawra* and the </strong>Temple of Eridu<strong> are highlighted for the continued use from the earliest </strong>Ubaid** levels, tracing their architectural development over time, detailing the socio-economic aspects that can be deduced archaeologically. </p>

        <p>&laquo;This essay has a two-fold purpose: to survey cuneiform texts that can be considered humorous, and to outline, if only in brief, the <strong>social context of Mesopotamian humor</strong>. Whether or not it is true that man alone of the animals is able to laugh, laughter is loss of inhibition, and the man who laughs is at once most human and most himself. The sense of humor revels in the inevitable gap between what is and what is supposed to be: for example, the pleasant delusion of self-presentation and the self as others see it, the reality of the body and the pretense of clothes and scents, ambition as opposed to performance. Humor is aware of this gap, wit expresses it, and laughter is the grateful acknowledgment of that expression&raquo; (p. 69).</p>
<p>[The paper investigates the sense and hidden meaning of <strong>humor in ancient Mesopotamian wisdom literature</strong>, used to convey messages of sageness in an elaborate (and sometimes elusive) literary-rhetorical  way.]</p>

        <p>In this article, Foster analyzes the few works of Akkadian literature whose authors can be identified - thus including the poem of Erra. At pp. 19-21, the author discusses the final lines of the composition and he synthesizes its contents as follows: &laquo;This passage contains [1] a summary of the story (lines 40 4l), and then [2] increasingly elaborate references to the text of the poem itself: <strong>first as a text with a human author</strong> (line 42)<strong>, then as a revelation of Ishum, the divine protagonist of the poem, a revelation acceptable and pleasing to Erra, the subject</strong> (lines 45 46). Thereupon, <strong>with that divine acceptance, the text becomes [3] a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; (<em>ittu</em>) of Erra</strong> (line 47), that all the gods will heed and respect to their advantage (lines 49 50), and then [4] a &ldquo;naming&rdquo; of Erra (lines 51, 56, 6l), [5] a &ldquo;praising&rdquo; of him (lines 52, 60), and, at last, [6] a &ldquo;song&rdquo; to be performed as well as studied and transmitted in centers of learning (lines 53 57). Actual manuscripts of the poem could be talismans against harm (lines 57 58).&raquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Foster looks for - and finds - similar features in other Akkadian texts whose explicitly-mentioned author refers to the genesis, divine approval of, composition and authority of his text. And yet, <em>Erra</em> is the only poem in which all these features are present at the same time.</p>
<p>The scholar then explains the presence (or, rather, absence) of the author&rsquo;s name in Akkadian literature in light of the preference of Mesopotamian artistic tradition to stress the outside source of the inspiration for the text, so as to make the works unique and significant. Indeed, the &ldquo;inspired uniqueness&rdquo; of such works was stressed by poets themselves - so that the texts represented the climax of their own narratives. Considered to be an act of naming or praise (see points [4] and [5], above), it was paramount to give the name of the subject praised - while the absence of the praiser&rsquo;s name provided the text with an aura of universality.</p>

        <p>Foster investigates the &ldquo;scanty but suggestive&rdquo; Mesopotamian sources which shed light on the ancient eschatological thought - defined as «a message of hope that good will be rewarded and evil punished, or, at least, the world will be remade so as to justify a specific religious belief in the face of greater, non-believing political and military power.» (p. 25). He focuses in particular on a small group of late documents (dated to the Achaemenid and Hellenistic time), called &lsquo;prophecies&rsquo; or &lsquo;apocalypses&rsquo; by the scholars.</p>
<p>Foster identifies in these texts «a Mesopotamian background to Jewish apocalyptic, originating perhaps in Babylonia under Achaemenid rule, even as a protest to it» (p. 25). The scholar maintains that such eschatological thought was a late development in Mesopotamia, and looks for the reason for the absence of such thought in earlier times. He finds the answer in the Mesopotamian account of the Deluge: indeed, Foster maintains that, from an ancient Near Eastern perspective, the world had already ended in that remote past and therefore men were not expecting any other apocalypse. «(Third)&hellip; the flood is clearly understood &hellip; to be a one-time event, never to recur. There was no waiting for a second flood and computing the time until it would occur. Fourth, no era of bliss followed.» (pp. 27-28).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;end of the world&rdquo; was unthinkable in the Mesopotamian view also because gods needed men to work the fields and maintain order on the earth, so that they could continue to be properly venerated, nourished, dressed and looked after in temples. Foster agrees that scholars of ancient Mesopotamia thought deeply about human suffering, but he comes to the conclusion that «a Babylonian might have considered eschatological dreams absurd, based on the experiences of real life, and possibly blasphemous, as human beings were scarcely in a position to redesign the world.» (p. 31).</p>

        <p>This book offers an <strong>analytic study of the Akkadian period of Mesopotamian history</strong>, which saw the rise and fall of the world’s first empire. The author offers his definition of &ldquo;empire&rdquo; at p. 83: «”Empire” is used here in its conventional sense of supreme and extensive political dominion, presided over by dynastic rulers, who claimed extraordinary, even superhuman or divine powers. It was an entity put together and maintained by force, with provinces administered by officials sent out from the capital in the heartland.» (p. 6).
The book begins with a well-grounded historical framework of the rise and fall of Akkad, from Sargon to Sharkalisharri. Foster offers an overview of the people and land of Akkad, including the socio-religious structures of the empire; he makes use of both epigraphical and archaeological sources. Within his discussion of Akkadian centers and settlements, the author offers two maps (at pp. 51, 81) which help conceptualizing the geography of the Akkadian Empire and the relationship between the various civic centers. Foster then analyzes many aspects of the everyday life in this period: agriculture (and diet), ceramic, economy and production; he discusses at length religion and temples as well as politics and military - through which the Akkadian Empire enabled trade, business, and economic growth. Finally, the scholar discusses art and literacy in this historical period (a few original sources are also available in translation in the appendixes at the end of the book), including the human values and expression of identity of this specific culture. The last chapter, then, explores how the Empire has been presented in modern historiography, from the decipherment of cuneiform to the present.</p>

        <p>&laquo;The article discusses the Mesopotamian commentary corpus, assesses its intellectual underpinnings, explores its place within Mesopotamia’s scholarly tradition, and addresses the question of whether Mesopotamian hermeneutics should be considered a “philosophical” pursuit. It is argued that the cuneiform commentaries are characterized, on one hand, by certain limitations and, on the other, by an overabundance of interpretational opportunities, and that the answer should therefore be negative; but it is admitted that, depending on what one considers the defining features of philosophy, other views are possible&raquo; (author’s <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/janeh/5/1-2/article-p107.xml?tab_body=abstract">abstract</a> on p. 107).</p>

Preceding Book I is a brief Introduction that focuses on the contrasting views of kingship in the two societies as expressed in their art&raquo; (from OI’s website).</p>
<p>[In Book II, the author presents a discussion on the origin and nature of Mesopotamian kingship, specifically focusing on the <strong>relationship between king, gods, and nature</strong> (Part VII), analysing also the topic of the identification of the king with specific gods and the deification of kings in Mesopotamia.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;This volume intended a journey to the origin of thought and theory through mythopoetic tales and religions of ancient Near East including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Israel. It is a substantial source to reveal the ancient man’s perspectives of the world, gods, and himself. The writers aimed to deal with speculative thought concerning the nature of the universe, the function of the state, and the values of life. They argued that speculation found unlimited possibilities for development in ancient Near East because it was not restricted by a scientific (that is, a disciplined) search for truth. They also noticed that the realm of nature and the realm of man were not distinguished. The experiencing of this unity with the utmost intensity was the greatest good ancient oriental religion could bestow&raquo; (from <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/intellectual-adventure-ancient-man-essay-speculative-thought-ancient-near#:~:text=Ancient%20Near%20East-,The%20Intellectual%20Adventure%20of%20Ancient%20Man%3A%20An%20Essay%20on%20Speculative,%2C%20H.%20A.%20Frankfort%2C%20John%20A.&amp;text=This%20volume%20intended%20a%20journey,Egypt%2C%20Mesopotamia%2C%20and%20Israel.">OI website</a>).</p>

More in detail, section 2 on Mesopotamia (by Th.

        <p>This paper provides evidence of the inaugural lecture given by Frankfort as Director of the Warburg Institute and Professor of the History of Pre-Classical Antiquity in the University of London (in 1949). Frankfort selected the topic of the figure of the &ldquo;dying god&rdquo; as case-study aimed at investigating the relations between the Greeks and their predecessors in and around the Eastern Mediterranean. He believed that &laquo;the variations in the cults and myths of this god are a good illustration of the extraordinary complexity which the problem of the survival of cultural forms may assume&raquo; (p. 141).</p>
<p>In the opening paragraphs, Frankfort warns against the application of modern concepts to ancient ideas, and points out how a wrong approach, characterized by the use of abstractions and generalization in the analysis of other cultures, would prevent a profound comprehension of the phenomenon under investigation. &laquo;The dying god is one of those imaginative conceptions in which early man made his emotional and intellectual preoccupations explicit. We disregard a great deal if we say that it expresses only man&rsquo;s concern with the course of the seasons&raquo; (p. 143).</p>
<p>Frankfort describes in details, mentioning literary and mythical sources, different cases of dying gods in their specific cultural contexts, beginning with Tammuz in ancient Mesopotamia and continuing with Osiris (Egypt), Adonis and Attis (Syria and Anatolia). Then, turning to Greece, he discusses the divine figures of Hyakinthos, Persephone, and the mythus of Orpheus. Finally, the scholar asks whether the various conceptions of the dying god can be said to survive the cultural setting in which they were born. He admits that he himself had firstly said that only by avoiding generalizations a modern reader could do justice to the evidence. &laquo;The most characteristic features, which are also the dominant features of each cult, never survive because each cult reflects the view which an ancient people took of the world in which it found itself&raquo; (p. 150). And yet, Frankfort at the same time maintains that &laquo;to deny survival in any form is surely absurd. (&hellip;) Our understanding of the Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Greek beliefs about a dying god is to some extent determined by a religious experience with which we ourselves are familiar&raquo; (pp. 150-151).</p>

        <p>This article proposes a <strong>dating for the Song of the Sea (Ex 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judg 5)</strong>. Freedman proposes that the former should be assigned to about 1175 BCE, and the latter to about 1125.
One important piece of information that leads to this dating is the coexistence of the four peoples mentioned in Ex. 15:14-15. The Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Canaanites coexisted only during the 12<sup>th</sup> century BCE. (The apparent contradiction with the Marniptah victory stele can be resolved by proposing, as Freedman does, that a political unit called Israel already existed in Syria-Palestine, but had neither attained statehood nor adopted Yahwism.)</p>
<p>Thus <strong>Freedman conjectures that the group referred to in the Song of the Sea brought Yahwism to the northern territory</strong> and later became an integral part of that political and tribal group. This conclusion is supported by the lack of any mention of conquest of Canaan and no mention of the patriarchs or a promised land: &ldquo;there is no obvious link between Yahweh and the God of the Fathers.&rdquo; (p. 11) In Freedman&rsquo;s view, the Egyptian slaves were an &ldquo;undefined mixture of stateless people&rdquo; who secured a unique leader, and emerged as the &ldquo;people of Yahweh&rdquo;. Later, they would become part of Israel, as the Song of Deborah suggests.</p>
<p>The Song of Deborah (Judg 5) celebrates the victory in battle at the Kishon river. It contains a list of ten tribes, lacking Judah, Simeon, and Levi, which Freedman interprets to mean that &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; was in the twelfth century a confederation of ten tribes. The complete 12 tribe lists are to be dated later: &ldquo;It is my contention that an original twelve-tribe league in Canaan bore the name Israel, and included Simeon, Levi, and the ten tribes mentioned in the Song of Deborah, but not Judah, which had a separate history. The two tribes, Simeon and Levi, were dropped from membership, and the remaining ten-tribe group, pictured in the Song of Deborah, constituted the Israelite federation in the twelfth and early part of the eleventh century B.C. It is possible that efforts were made to reconstitute a twelve-tribe league including Judah and Simeon during the eleventh century under the leadership of Samuel, but clear evidence is lacking. Out of this league, the monarchy emerged, with Saul as the first king (<em>melek</em>) or dynastic ruler (<em>nagid</em>) of Israel. A similar development took place in the south with David becoming king of Judah, apparently before the death of Saul. After the death of Ishbaal, under David&rsquo;s forceful leadership the two kingdoms were united, only to fall apart again after the death of his son Solomon.&rdquo; (p. 17)</p>

        <p>The first part describes the &ldquo;<strong>disappearance of God</strong>&rdquo; in the Bible. That is to say, the progressive diminishment of public manifestations: the emblematic contrast is between Exodus on one hand (from the miracles in Egypt up to the conquest) and the reconstruction with Esdra on the other (where the emphasis is exclusively on the institutional ordering of the temple.)</p>
<p>The second part deals with the concept of the &ldquo;<strong>death of God</strong>&rdquo; as it was elaborated especially by Nietzsche, in contrast with a surprisingly similar theme in Dostoyevsky. &ldquo;Death&rdquo; as such is referred to &ldquo;a situation which existed and which is finished&rdquo; and in this sense does not coincide perfectly with the notion implicit in the title of the book, which is the disappearance or the self-hiding of God. What changes is in fact &ldquo;the perception of the presence of God by humans&rdquo; (p. 208).</p>

        <p>In this contribution, Freud tries to explain (on the base of a psychoanalytical approach) the <strong>origin and the modern decline of religious thought</strong>. To sum up in few words, religious thought originated from the incapability of human beings (mostly during their childhood) to explain natural phaenomena. Hence the origin (the ‘creation’ or ‘invention’) of gods and religion. Due to the modern, increasing development of scientific speculation, this ancestral need for a religious explanation of ununderstood natural phaenomena is no more active (or needed at all).</p>

        <p>&laquo;There is no equivalent expression for the <strong>word ‘demon’</strong> in the Semitic languages and furthermore, in the Old Testament no conjuration ritual is mentioned. That leads to a diverse and divergent use of the term ‘demon’ in scholarly literature. The author suggests we avoid the use of the word ‘demon’ for the interpretation of Old Testament texts and Syro-Palestinian iconography. It seems to be more helpful to interpret the texts and pictures individually and to analyze the functions of the so-called ‘demons’ in their own special context&raquo; (author’s abstract on p. 38).</p>
<p>[The author addresses in this paper the problem of the definition of ‘demons’ in the Bible and in the Ancient Near East, both on a philological and a conceptual level. The same topic is specifically dealt with by G. Buccellati in his volume. Both the authors randomly reach the same conclusion: a general and all-comprehensive definition of ‘demons’ in the Bible and in The Ancient Near East is elusive; therefore, the best approach is to consider each specific case as a <em>unicum</em>.]</p>

        <p>This article provides a thorough analysis and contextualization of the cuneiform tablet K.5268+K.5333a, which is a bilingual hymn to Nergal written not only as a prayer for the benefit of Bel-remanni, but first and foremost as a thanksgiving hymn to Nergal following Bel-remanni’s salvation. In order to provide the proper backround for this source, Gabbay discusses the existence of other thanksgiving hymns in Sumerian and Akkadian literature; he focuses his attention in particular on those compositions that name the individual who has experienced salvation. Gabbay, then, asks what is the significance of naming an individual in a prayer?</p>
<p>The scholar states that, in addition to apotropaic, theological, and liturgical functions, prayers also had another function: they bore witness to (supposedly) actual events that were experienced by actual individuals. «Testimony to an act of salvation by a god substantiates and validates the belief system relating to this god, and consequently strengthens it. (&hellip;) These texts declare the
society’s acknowledgement of the power of the god and then ask for the god’s blessing, which explicitly or implicitly indicates that receipt of the blessing will be a further testimony that will validate this widespread belief and further confirm the power of the god in society» (p. 226).</p>

        <p>&laquo;The objective of the present study is to present a new, coherent scheme for <strong>Mesopotamian chronology</strong> during the second millennium. Because Susa is one of the few excavated sites that shows a continuity in occupation between the time of the fall of Babylon and c. 1400 BC and, in addition, yields ceramic information for the Babylonian corpus, we also connect the Elamite chronology with the Babylonian system of dating. On the other hand, although the absolute chronologies throughout the Ancient Near East are largely dependent on Babylonian data, they are given less consideration here because the archaeological evidence from there areas is only remotely related to the stemming from Mesopotamia and therefore lies outside the scope of this study&raquo; (from authors’ <em>Praface</em>, p. 2). </p>
<p>[This volume enriches the discussion that G. Buccellati presents in his volume about the definition of a Mesopotamian chronology based on astronomical observations.]</p>

        <p>In this contribution, Geertz aims to define religion from a cultural standpoint. Thus, he provides at first his definition of &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;religion&rdquo; - the first being &laquo;an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life&raquo; (p. 89). Religion is then defined as <strong>&laquo;(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic&raquo;</strong> (p. 90).
At the core of this definition is the idea that religion consists of a set of interrelated (elsewhere referred to as &ldquo;sacred&rdquo;) symbols that fuse an ethos, i.e. a set of &laquo;powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations&raquo;, with a world view, i.e., a set of &laquo;conceptions of a general order of existence&raquo;.</p>
<p>In order to explain why men create religious symbols, Geertz looks at the kinds of problems that religion aims at solving for people; with regards to the &ldquo;problem of evil&rdquo;, he maintains that men formulate, by means of religious symbols, &laquo;an image of such a genuine order of the world which will account for, and even celebrate, the perceived ambiguities, puzzles, and paradoxes in human experience.&raquo; (p. 107f).</p>
<p>Geertz also provides a definition for ritual: <strong>&laquo;a consecrated behavior&raquo;</strong> in which <strong>&laquo;the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world&raquo;</strong> (p. 112). And he stresses that it is in ritual, especially in its more elaborate and public forms, that ethos and world view can best be observed by an external observer. According to Geertz, while we cannot perceive the world exactly as it is perceived by the believer, one can still study how the believer uses symbols thus gaining an idea of how a religion is understood by its adherents.</p>
<p>Finally, Geertz highlights how &laquo;religion is sociologically interesting not because it describes the social order, but because, like environment, political power, wealth, jural obligation, personal affection, and a sense of beauty, it shapes it&raquo; (p. 119).</p>
<p>[20 years after the publication of this volume, Geertz&rsquo;s view has been challenged by Asad in his article &ldquo;The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category&rdquo; (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Asad1993ReligionAnthropologicalCategory">Asad 1993 Religion Anthropological Category</a>)]</p>

        <p>«Alfred Gell puts forward a new anthropological theory of visual art, seen as a form of instrumental action: the making of things as a means of influencing the thoughts and actions of others. He argues that existing anthropological and aesthetic theories take an overwhelmingly passive point of view, and questions the criteria that accord art status only to a certain class of objects and not to others. The anthropology of art is here reformulated as the anthropology of a category of action: Gell shows how art objects embody complex intentionalities and mediate social agency. He explores the psychology of patterns and perceptions, art and personhood, the control of knowledge, and the interpretation of meaning, drawing upon a diversity of artistic traditions — European, Indian, Polynesian, Melanesian, and Australian.» [Editor’s summary]</p>
<p>[Gell suggests that <strong>commensality must be considered as a tool for recognising the role of non-human entities within the human and social universe: thus, serving food to an inanimate being, such as a statue or an icon, had sense because it prompted a causal sequence, which had an impact on human life</strong>. In his work, Gell does not explicitly mention Mesopotamia but he discusses similar Egyptian religious practices, see pp. 134-135.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;With the increase in knowledge of Mesopotamian incantations, through the publication of the new edition of Akkadian and Sumerian incantation series, it is now possible to search for closer cultural ties between Mesopotamian and Israelite rituals. In this vein, a <strong>comparative study of <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&amp;prq=5&amp;psq=1&amp;lvl=99&amp;pnt=tru&amp;acc=tru&amp;dia=tru&amp;enc=heb&amp;xml=fls">Lev.

        <p>In this volume, George offers a philological edition of Akkadian texts which together make a useful collection of information regarding the Babylonian gods and their cult places within the temple complexes in Mesopotamian cities such as Babylon, Nippur, and Assur. The book also includes many details regarding the topography of Babylon.</p>
<p>While investigating the main text analyzed in the volume, i.e. the one named &ldquo;Tintir = Babylon&rdquo;, George also discusses relevant historical issues such as the &ldquo;syncretism&rdquo; of Babylon and the ancient city of Eridu which took place in the Kassite period, following the syncretism between Enki and his son Asalluhi (patron gods of Eridu) with the Babylonian god Ea and his son Marduk. It is also likely that the description of Babylon included in &ldquo;Tintir = Babylon&rdquo; may reflect an idealised record of the city, with exact measurements of its streets, gates, and major buildings, rather than a realistic depiction of Babylon itself.</p>

        <p>Glassner opens his text with a clear statement: there is an indissoluble bond between the Power and the Sacred: the sacred is part of the very structure of power («Il existe entre le Pouvoir et le Sacré un lien indissoluble: le sacré fait partie de la structure même du pouvoir.», p.9).</p>
<p>In this paper, the scholar reviews the many theories proposed in Assyriology on the topic of &ldquo;king-priest&rdquo;, from Deimel (1920) onward - with many bibliographical references. Then, he offers his own assessment based on philological, iconographical and historical evidence. Ultimately, Glassner states that - though the religious character of the royalty in Mesopotamian cannot be doubted, we do not see that the Mesopotamian kings ever exercised, in the first half of the third millennium BCE, the functions of priests. There is, moreover, no evidence of a Mesopotamian society where the king-priest had the exclusivity of any ritual. However, Glassner identifies an exception in the figure of the king Lugalzage.si - particularly on the basis of an inscription in which he presented himself as the king of Uruk and priest of the goddess Nisaba. Indeed, this may be explained by the fact that Lugalzagesi was the son of a priest - a function which the son probably took up as an inheritance: that a high-ranking priest could rise to royal dignity is not strange in Mesopotamia: two similar cases are known, those of Il (sanga of Zabalam who became king of Umma) and of En.entar.zi (sanga of the god Ningirsu who became king of Lagash).</p>

        <p>This paper begins by questioning the assumption that the ancient Mesopotamian society made no distinction between an offering, a libation, or a sacrifice - an assumption that arose in the Assyriological discipline from the fact that one same word could designate either of these acts. Indeed, Glassner begins his text with an accurate analysis of the lexicon which was used in ancient Akkadian texts to describe actions connected to offerings and sacrifices.</p>
<p>Glassner intends &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; as a ritual oblation to invisible forces, characterized by the voluntary abandonment, sometimes destruction, of the offered thing. The bloody sacrifice is only one particular case, but the main focus of such act is the idea of renunciation that is at the center of the procedure. He also notes that, since the same words for &ldquo;to slaughter&rdquo; or &ldquo;to kill&rdquo; are used in different contexts (whatever the purpose of the act), the priest&rsquo;s gesture was distinguishable from that of the butcher only by the pronunciation of different words.</p>
<p>Glassner analyzes every aspect of the Mesopotamian sacrifice: at first, its aetiology (by taking into consideration Sumerian and Akkadian literaty texts) - then its practical features, with a particular focus on the daily meals offered to the gods in the Temple of Anu at Uruk during the Seleucid times. The scholar also discusses the ingredients that were brought to the divine tables, as well as every aspect of the divinatory sacrifice (preparatory phases, the oracular consultation, and conclusive moments of the ceremony).</p>

        <p>This article analyses the iconographical representation of gestures in Assyrian reliefs and it provides a useful list of the conventional gestures (for a total of 35) that were most commonly represented in Assyrian art, as well as in some earlier Old Babylonian and Akkadian examples. The variety of iconographies described in this article indicate different emotions: piety, salutation, surrender, intercession, acknowledgment, humility, adoration, prayer, etc. The most documented are the devotional gestures, which might also be aligned with textual references (for example the so-called <em>laban appi</em> - the touching of the nose as a mark of prayer -, and the &ldquo;lifting of the hand&rdquo;).</p>

        <p>[Author&rsquo;s summary] The concept of divine wrath is important in the Hebrew Bible not only in explaining the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile at the hands of the Babylonians, but also in interpreting the reconstruction of the temple and the city during the early Persian period from a theological perspective. This essay investigates the role of Yhwh&rsquo;s anger in Zech 1-8, where it is given a special emphasis in the context of the reconstruction. Two conceptions of <strong>divine wrath</strong> are highlighted within this composition, which, it is argued, result from a complex literary growth involving a process of successive reinterpretations. The central section (Zech 1:7-6:15), recounting Zechariah&rsquo;s visions, depicts the wrath of <strong>Yhwh against Jerusalem and Judah as temporary and limited in intensity</strong>, in contrast to his overwhelming anger against the foreign nations; this conception serves to stress that Yhwh has not reneged on his choice of Jerusalem as his cultic place. It is best understood as legitimating the reconstruction of the second temple in the early Persian period and promoting its cult. By contrast, the oracles in Zech 1:1-6; 7-8 that frame the visions present <strong>Yhwh&rsquo;s anger against his people as strong and also unstable, in that it can be triggered at any time if the Judeans behave wrongly</strong>. This conception of divine wrath served to promote social justice within Judea and to enhance the authority of prophetic texts. It is best read as a later explanation of why the promises of restoration of Jerusalem and Judah were not fulfilled; moreover, the emphasis on social justice in these oracles points to a social setting among a scribal group that was involved in the regulation of socio-economical relations within the province.</p>

        <p>&laquo;The importance of proverbs for understanding a people has been long known; as Francis Bacon put it, “The genius, wit and spirit of a nation are discovered in its proverbs.” To quote a modern writer, proverbs “are the safest index to the inner life of a people. With their aid we can construct a mental image of the conditions of existence, the manners, characteristics, morals and Weltanschauung of the community which used them. They present us with the surest data upon which to base our knowledge of Volkspsychologie”&raquo; (from author’s <em>Introduction</em>, p. 1).</p>
<p>This paper collects some <strong>Sumerian proverbs</strong> exemplifying the subtle wisdom literature of ancient Mesopotamian people, with a look on Sumerian everyday life or, even more worthy, on their way to interpretate events and behaviours of their daily experience. </p>

        <p>This article aims to investigate the role of perception, beliefs, and norms internalised by relevant social actors within the context of foreign relations in the ancient Near East. The author focuses in particular on covenant treaties, defined as «a highly stylised ceremonial performance of a treaty or agreement» which he considers to be the most obvious link between oaths and curses (p. 664).</p>
<p>Grassi Freire firstly discusses the practice of covenanting and the stylised format of a covenant treaty. Then, he discusses the background of covenantal oaths and curses, and the notion of covenant-breaking as a sin that attracts divine curses. Afterwards the author analyzes the representative position of kings in the execution of oaths and curses, to conclude with a discussion on the role played by prophets in linking specific curses (or blessings) to specific patterns of political behaviour.</p>

        <p>&laquo;In historical times, and doubtless in the prehistoric period also, the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia &ndash; Assyria in the north and Babylonia to the south, the land roughly corresponding to the present-day state of Iraq &ndash; were believers in contending forces of <strong>good</strong> and <strong>evil</strong> and in a plethora of different more-or-Iess distinct <strong>demons</strong> whose good services would benefit the individual or the community or whose evil deeds, and malicious instincts, might bring hardship, ill fortune, disease or death. This may have been particularly marked in the late second and in the first millennia B.C., when the higher forms of religious expression may have been in decline and have given way to such <strong>superstitions</strong>.

        <p>&laquo;We outline the priority of high quality data of astronomical content as our strategy for the analysis of the ancient <strong>astronomical records</strong> in the search of the absolute chronology of the Near East in II millennium BC. The correspondingly defined set of data for two lunar eclipses of EAE 20 and 21 tablets linked to Ur III period enables us the choice of eclipses of 27 June 1954 BC and 17 March 1912 BC; here the information on the exit position of the darkening of the lunar disk acts as a crucial informator survived in the records. We then discuss why the 56/64 year <strong>Venus cycle</strong> cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. The month length method is discussed as well. In sum the available data support the Ultra-Low Chronology proposed in the book by H. Gasche, J.A. Armstrong, S.W. Cole and V.G. Gurzadyan, “Dating the Fall of Babylon” (1998) and, particularly, leave no astronomical background for the High Chronology.

        <p>&laquo;It is shown that the refraction near the horizon is introducing an additional bias into the <strong>Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa</strong>, which is able to influence the interpretation of the data.

        <p>&laquo;The recently shown two premises (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Gurzadyan2000Astronomical">Gurzadyan 2000 Astronomical</a>), i.e. the absence of 56/64 year <strong>Venus cycle</strong> constraints, at the importance of the 8-year cycle in the <strong>Venus Tablet</strong>, stimulated new studies on the Chronology of the Ancient Near East (2nd millennium BC). The analysis by B.

        <p>The book of Jubilees, written in the middle of the second century BCE, gives pride of place to demons in the rewritten passages of Genesis and Exodus. During a long time in scholarship, Mastema was known as another name of the demon Satan because of a common etymology. A close examination of both occurrences in the book of Jubilees invites us to <strong>reconsider the relationship between Mastema and Satan in the direction of two separate demons</strong> with different functions in the narrative. Thus, Mastema stands out as an agent of YHWH which oversees the demons in their deeds against nations and Israel. Mastema accomplished another mission by taking the place of God in the passages deemed incompatible with divine goodness. Finally, Mastema endorses the ignominious deeds of God in history in order to explain that God Almighty be angry and punish his people. Consequently, the divine repentance is not necessary. [Author&rsquo;s summary] </p>
<p>[Hamidović notices that Mastema&rsquo;s meaning as a name, a title and a role are blurry. He points out the attempt to resolve the problem of <strong>theodicy</strong> by ascribing violent actions to Mastema, who obeys the commands of YHWH. This solution to the problem of evil in the book of Jubilees, late in the formation of the Hebrew canon and on the outer boundaries of Jewish orthodoxy, seems to recover some of the features of polytheism: YHWH is absolved of all ambiguity, which is to say that his actions are predictable and orderly. Mastema represents a part of YHWH&rsquo;s behavior that is apparently incoherent with his goodness. A further consequence of this doubling of the divine principle is that YHWH no longer need &ldquo;repent&rdquo; of his actions. In this, too, <strong>Mastema seems to represent a return to polytheism</strong>, in which divine actions were distributed among multiple figures, eliminating the pressing need for divine repentance.]</p>

        <p>In this monograph, the author explores the portrayal of God as found in <em>Gen.</em> 18.1-15 and 32.23-33: there, the Biblical God is depicted as interacting with humans in anthropomorphically realistic form, a phenomenon that Hamori labels the &ldquo;<em>&lsquo;&#238;&#353;</em> theophany&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The volume analyses the history of scholarship, looking at how scholars have - or rather have not - investigated the many varieties of anthropomorphic portrayal of deities which serve different narrative and theological functions in human religions. She states that so far, the only difference which has been made is the one between anthropomorphism and anthropopathism, also called &ldquo;physical&rdquo; and &ldquo;psychical&rdquo; anthropomorphism. The author, instead, identifies and describes a &ldquo;taxonomy&rdquo; of physical anthropomorphism, whose forms she identifies as concrete, envisioned, immanent, transcendent and figurative.</p>
<p>In chapter 6, Hamori offers a survey of Mesopotamian cases of divine anthropomorphism, with the purpose of describing &laquo;the place of anthropomorphically realistic portrayal of deity within the broader scope of ancient Near Eastern mythology&raquo; (p. 129). From this survey, she infers that a pattern exists throughout the Mesopotamian religious literary texts, &laquo;of a general movement in the direction of greater division between heaven and earth as separate realms&raquo; (p. 143) starting from the Sumerian material till the late Akkadian texts. </p>
<p>When comparing the Biblical and the Mesopotamian material, thus, Hamori concludes that &laquo;The phenomenon of the <em>&lsquo;&#238;&#353;</em> theophany has no counterpart in Akkadian mythology any more than in Sumerian. There appears to be no stage of Mesopotamian thought as reflected in texts from the Sumerian mythology through the late Akkadian material in which divine beings break into the earthly realm in fully anthropomorphically realistic form in order to engage with humans. There is then no period or body of material in which anthropomorphic realism and direct corporeal divine-human contact coexist in Mesopotamia. So far, this mode of divine-human communication is only attested in Biblical literature.&raquo;</p>

        <p>This article outlines the approach by the French school of <strong>historiography</strong> known as <em>Annales</em>. The presentation of history as a scientific report of facts would not reach its potential until the 18th century under the scholarship of <strong>Leopold von Ranke</strong> in Germany. In France, the periodical <strong>Annales: Economies, Sociétés, Civilizations</strong>, was originated by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch during an era of <strong>Marxist</strong> scholarship. The <em>Annales</em> school of thought encorporated an interdisciplinary trinity of <strong>Serialism</strong>, <strong>Structuralism</strong> and <strong>Functionalism</strong> to the study of history, championing the concept of history as the <strong>synthesis</strong> of economics, society and culture - birthing the <strong><em>longue durée</em></strong>. Serialism represents the aim of achieving the “greatest possible measure of scientific rigor”, most evident in the study of demographics as an objective form of census. Structuralism requires building models of “social structures” and the examination of variables as they relate to each other and the whole. Functionalism seeks to understand the <strong>interaction</strong> between the concept of “total history” as it can be deduced from the study of economies, societies and civilizations. Braudel’s <em>pensée globale</em> sought to encompass the totality of a civilization for the purpose of “weighing” it for cultural comparison. Criticisms of the Annales school included the deliberate avoidance of politics and issues of the state. </p>

        <p>The aim of the present article is to contextualise the boat metaphors used in Mesopotamian literary expression through a survey of the pertinent sources, covering a time frame of roughly 2000 years. The author&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to understand the semantic relationship that was understood by the people using the metaphor of the pregnant woman and the fully laden boat, and by those who heard it. The first part of the article focuses on the cargo of the boat, i.e. the unborn child that the woman carries in her womb. In the second part, the boat itself is investigated in the light of Mesopotamian metaphors or similes.
The article offers an <strong>overall coherent understanding of the boat metaphor and its relation to the pregnant woman or childbirth</strong>: firstly, it recalls the literary tradition according to which the pregnant woman was similar to a vessel carrying a cargo of precious items (that represented the unborn baby) - typically aromatics, cedar, carnelian and lapis lazuli. Then, the author also highlights that numerous uses of the boat metaphor in literary figurative language were not restricted to the specific case of a pregnant woman, but they could also be applied to all humans. Thus, the difficulties experienced by a boat were a metaphor for difficulties in a person&rsquo;s life. Bringing this image to the extreme consequences, the image of the sinking of a boat existed as a euphemistic expression for death. Consequently, the sinking of a boat filled with goods came to identify the death of a pregnant woman.</p>

        <p>This paper investigates the Mesopotamian concept of noise which, as also stated by Buccellati in §8.5, is recognised as a cause of disorder and divine anger. In analyzing the literary poem of <em>Atrahasis</em> in comparison with Mesopotamian incantations, the author identifies a parallel theme which consists in the sequence of noise - disruption of divine sleep - divine anger.</p>
<p>Heffron provides a useful overview on previous studies on the issue of &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in <em>Atrahasis</em>, questioning whether - according to the two main traditional views - this should be understood as a metaphor for sinfulness or, rather, &lsquo;simply&rsquo; as the inevitable
result of unrestricted procreation. In <em>Atrahasis</em>, the &ldquo;noise of humankind&rdquo; (<em>rigim awiluti</em>) appears in a causative relationship with the Flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity: modern scholarship has thus regarded this noise as an allusion to something more &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this article, the two opposed scholarly interpretations of &lsquo;noise&rsquo; in the Mesopotamian myth are defined as the &lsquo;biblical&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Malthusian&rsquo; readings. The first models its explanation of the Mesopotamian Flood on a Judeo-Christian account of human sin leading to divine punishment; the second sees the ultimate cause of the Flood in human overpopulation. While providing plenty of biblical references to previous studies on these issues, Heffron offers a fresh contextualization to the theme of noise, suggesting that an intermediate phase should be identified between noise and divine anger, namely the disruption of divine sleep.</p>

        <p>&laquo;This book presents an interdisciplinary study of the role of <strong>spirituality</strong> and <strong>religious ritual</strong> in the emergence of complex societies. Involving an eminent group of natural scientists, archaeologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and theologians, this volume examines <strong>Çatalhöyük</strong> as a case study. A nine-thousand-year old town in central Turkey, Çatalhöyük was first excavated in the 1960s and has since become integral to understanding the symbolic and ritual worlds of the early farmers and village-dwellers in the Middle East. It is thus an ideal location for exploring theories about the role of religion in early settled life. This book provides a unique overview of current debates concerning religion and its historical variations. Through exploration of themes including the integration of the spiritual and the material, the role of belief in religion, the cognitive bases for religion, and religion&rsquo;s social roles, this book situates the results from Çatalhöyük within a broader understanding of the Neolithic in the Middle East&raquo; (description on <a href="www.cambridge.org/9780521150194">editor’s webpage</a>).</p>
<p>The complex and ancient site of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük</a>, in Konya Plain (Anatolia), is here presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hodder">Ian Hodder</a> (the director of the excavations) as a study case in the emergence and development of the concept of <strong>religion</strong> in ancient Turkey and generally in ancient Near East, at the dawn of the Neolithic Period. </p>
<p>Hodder starts by presenting a basic <strong>methodological question</strong>: how to prove the presence of a religious thoughts in a so ancient site? The answer involves an interdisciplinary approach, a project which is wholly presented in this first chapter, discussing about the history and background of the project, asking how to approach the topic under an archaeological perspective, able to detect (or to decode) the traces of ancient spiritual thought and transcendentality in so ancient times, wandering how <strong>violence</strong> and <strong>death</strong> could contribute in the emergence of religiosity.</p>
<p>Later chapters deal with the <strong>symbolism</strong> of Çatalhöyük in its regional context, &laquo;to situate the symbolism and ritual at Çatalhöyük in the wider context of eastern Turkey and the Middle East&raquo; (p. 32), offering parallelisms with other Anatolian and Near Easter ancient sites.</p>
<p>Hodder concludes with some basic questions: a) &laquo;How can archaeologists recognize the spiritual, religious and transcendent in early time periods&raquo;?; b) &laquo;Are changes in spiritual life and religious ritual a necessary prelude to the social and economic changes that lead to ‘civilization’&raquo;?; c) &laquo;Do human forms take on a central role in the spirit world in the early Holocene, and, if so, does this centrality lead to new conceptions of human agency that themselves provide the possibility for the domestication of plants and animals?&raquo;; d) &laquo;Do violence and death act as the loci of transcendent religious experience during the transitions of the early Holocene in the Middle East, and are such themes central to the creation of social life in the first large agglomerations of people?&raquo;. The respective answers to such questions surely represent the most important goal and achievement of the entire volume.</p>
<p>[The contribution is relevant as an introduction to the first attested forms of religiosity and rituals in the ancient site of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük</a>, in Anatolia.]</p>

    <td class="summary">
        <p>Hoffner’s study discusses a few examples of Hittite documents that seek to justify a king who assumed the kingship by force. Part of this justification regards the relation with the gods. In the <strong>Decennial Annals of Mursili</strong>, the king complains that surrounding lords have taunted him. He therefore prayed to the sun goddess of Arinna, who heard his prayer and helped him subjugate the surrounding lands. </p>
<p>There are two clear examples of &laquo;apologies&raquo;: the <strong>Telepinu Proclamation</strong> and the <strong>Apology of Hattusili III</strong>. </p>
<p>In the Telepinu Proclamation, there are no divine workings on the king’s behalf. It is a largely unreligious document. At most, it indicates that the gods will revenge the murders of the kings and gives words of reproof spoken through the &laquo;men of the gods&raquo; (p. 53).
In the Apology of Hattusili, reasons for usurping the throne are more religious. First of all, the previous king Urhitesub is portrayed as incompetent and as an &laquo;evil man who has recourse to witchcraft (<em>alwanzatar</em>) and other means which displease the gods.&raquo; (p. 54). More fundamentally, his claim to kingship rests upon the will of the gods who have chosen him. The providence of Ishtar brings about victory. </p>
<p>Hoffner also provides fragmentary evidence for a possible precursor to Telepinu’s apology, in the form of a piece of political propaganda.</p>

        <p>This article aims to offer a synthetic analysis of the Mesopotamian divine sphere, by gathering and summarizing years of scholarly study (for which a rich and extremely useful bibliography is provided). After examining what was a &ldquo;god&rdquo; in ancient Mesopotamia and the essential qualities of Mesopotamian deities, Hundley discusses the relationship existing between the various deities, and between a single deity and its various aspects. He suggests that the Mesopotamian divine world was characterized by a fluidity which is difficult to understand or to compare with modern western religions.</p>
<p>According to Hundley, while anthropomorphism is the most prominent characteristic of the Mesopotamian divine, it does not entirely explain it. He looks for the original characteristics of deities in the original Mesopotamian sources, and states that they could be identified in at least three distinct ways: 1) by the use of the divine determinative; 2) in addition to such labeling, they could be called &ldquo;gods&rdquo; explicitly or behave in ways which were thought to be characteristic of the gods; 3) they could receive food offerings in the temples. On the iconographic side, there were signs that pointed to the divinity of visually depicted beings (such as the horned crown).</p>
<p>Deities were very often anthropomorphic, but there were non-anthropomorphic gods as well, together with human-animal or animal-animal hybrids and even inanimate beings (stars, planets, and other celestial bodies; natural phenomena and elements; human-made objects; abstract elements). The &ldquo;minimal quality&rdquo; which seems to have been applied to Mesopotamian deities was the ability to positively or negatively affecting humanity. In addition to this potency, other various other qualities were recognized to supernal entities, <em>in primis</em> awesomeness (the ability to elicit fear, fascination, and humility) and a divine radiance (especially in the first millennium BCE).</p>
<p>Hundley, then, investigates the Mesopotamian pantheon - considering it as a holistic ordering of the world, with a specific deity assigned to the areas of the cosmos they deemed important: the pantheon, then, reveals the ancient Mesopotamian attempt to understand and somehow even control the earthly world. He actually considers Mesopotamian gods as &ldquo;divine constellations&rdquo;, in which the various elements are connected to a more or less unified entity and share in its identity. In other words, each major god consists of a constellation of aspects, which may act and be treated (semi-)independently.&rdquo; (pp. 80-81)</p>

        <p><br><br>«In this book devoted exclusively to temples and perceptions of the divine presences that inhabit them, Michael B. Hundley focuses on the official religions of the ancient Near East and explores the interface between the human and the divine within temple environs. Hundley identifies common ancient Near Eastern temple systems and examines issues that include what temple structures communicate, how temples were understood to function, temple ideology, the installation of divine presence in a temple, the connection between presence and physical representation, and human service to the deity. Drawing on architectural and spatial theory, ritual theory, theories of language, art history, archaeology, sociocultural anthropology, and comparative studies, Hundley offers a single interpretive lens through which to view temple worship. Features: A close examination of temples in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Hittite Anatolia, and Syria-Palestine; an interdisciplinary treatment of architecture, language, ritual, and art; a dual focus on how a deity&rsquo;s divine presence connects to space and art and how human service to the deity maintains the deity&rsquo;s active presence» (editor&rsquo;s abstract).</p>

        <p>&laquo;Astronomy and astrology, or the <strong>astral sciences</strong>, played an enormous, if not a key role in the political and religious life of the Ancient Near East, and, later, of the Greek and Roman world. This is the first comprehensive and up-to-date account of the origins of the astral sciences in the Ancient Near East. Every type of Sumerian or Akkadian text dealing with descriptive or mathematical astronomy, including many individual tablets are thoroughly dealt with. All aspects, such as the history of discovery, reconstruction, and interpretation come to the fore, accompanied by a full bibliography. At that the reader will find descriptions of astronomical contents, an explanation of their scientific meaning and the place a given genre or tablet has in the development of astronomy both within the Mesopotamian culture and outside of it. Because celestial omens are intimately related to astronomy in Mesopotamian science, these are also discussed extensively. The material is arranged both chronologically and thematically, so as to help make <em>Astral Sciences in Mesopotamia</em> a reference work on the subject in its truest sense&raquo; (abstract from publisher’s webpage).</p>
<p>[G. Buccellati discusses in his volume the role of <strong>astrology and astral divination in ancient Mesopotamia</strong>, as a way to communicate with the absolute. This volume offers a wide analysis of Mesopotamian astrological texts, clearly exemplifying, by mean of primary sources, the topic discussed by G. Buccellati.]</p>

        <p>This volume is made of two parts: in the first, the author presents thematic analyses of a large number of Near Eastern building accounts (for example the Gudea cylinders, several Assyrian, Babylonian and Northwest Semitic royal inscriptions, biblical and post-biblical Jewish accounts). Then, in the second part he offers a comparative study of biblical accounts of the building of Solomon&rsquo;s temple in Jerusalem against the background of the sources previously examined. Hurowitz aims to elucidate the biblical source and, in order to reach his goal, he turns to comparative sources in order to identify applicable models.</p>
<p>The scholar ultimately concludes that the biblical building account is best understood precisely against the background of the ancient Near Eastern literary patterns, and that it should be qualified as a distinct genre. Not considering such comparative approach would result in a lack of understanding of the original sense of the biblical accounts themselves.</p>

        <p>Hurowitz surveys with a critical approach the various ways in which the terms &ldquo;canon,&rdquo; &ldquo;canonical,&rdquo; &ldquo;canonicity&rdquo; and &ldquo;canonization&rdquo; have been used by Assyriologists, questioning the applicability of such terms to the Ancient Mesopotamian reality.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;canon&rdquo; started in the twenties to be used to refer to a series of Akkadian written compositions which aimed at copying, preserving, transmitting, and standardizing the form of older texts. von Soden, in particular, defined the so-called &ldquo;canonical form&rdquo; of a text as &laquo;the recension of a scientific work or other literature which became for its contemporary surroundings the one authoritative work, with which nothing new could compete.&raquo; (quotation at p. 2). Hurowitz highlights how, according to these Assyriologists, the term &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; bears no connotations of a religiously inspired text, nor does it imply any normative authority to the text. </p>
<p>Overall, then, Hurowitz states that the modern usage of the terms &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; and &ldquo;canonization&rdquo; within the Mesopotamian studies are quite distinct from the religious notion of &lsquo;canon&rsquo; applied to the Hebrew Bible. He denies that Mesopotamia produced a literary corpus analogous to the canons of the western religions - stating that &laquo;the term <strong>&ldquo;canon&rdquo;</strong>, when applied to the Hebrew Bible (&hellip;) is a Christian term indicating <strong>a closed group of texts which are divinely inspired, stem from a &ldquo;mythological&rdquo; period of history when God openly communicated with men, are normative for the community, and actually define that community.</strong>&raquo; (p. 4). Finally, the author maintains that the only Mesopotamian example which - in his view - fills some functional requirements of &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; in the religious, ecclesiastical sense (divine inspiration, large audience and normative function) is the Codex Hammurapi.</p>

While rituals are often seen as infallible mechanisms which ‘work’ irrespective of the individual motivations of the performers, it is clearly visible here that rituals can fail, and that improper performances do in fact matter. These essays break new ground in their respective fields and the comparative analysis of rituals that go wrong introduces new perspectives to ritual studies.

        <p>The aims of this paper consists in re-defining the <strong>concept of ancient Mesopotamian religion</strong> in connection to specific “central concerns”, i.e. particular issues faced by Mesopotamian people, concrete needs leading them to the development of a religious sensibility/thought. These “concerns” are identified by the author with specific issues during the millennia: famine and natural disasters (in fourth millennium BC); war and ravages (in the third millennium BC); the sense of guilt (in the second millennium BC). The first millennium BC escapes this scheme, being a specific new “concern” absent: it was the time when Mesopotamian religious thought represented something like a fossil, reproducing previous ideas of the earlier millennia. Instead, it was elsewhere that in the first millennium BC new beginnings grow up, i.e. Israel and Greece, &laquo;who jointly become the fountainheads of Western Civilization&raquo; (p. 484). </p>
<p>[The main achievement of this paper consists in the author’s idea of retracing specific “concerns”, i.e. human needs or necessities, which led Mesopotamian people to develop religious responses to these multipolar issues which evolved and changed during three millennia, resulting during the first millennium BC in a kind of “religious repertoire” later expanded in Israel and Greece, in a connection between Western and Eastern cultural traditions.]</p>

        <p>The author examines the battle between Marduk and Tiamat in Enuma elish. He first examines the meaning of the two names. Tiamat is clearly identified as the sea. The meaning of the name Marduk is less clear, but strong reasons point to a meaning of Son of the storm (rather than Son of the Sun, another possible reading). A <strong>battle between the storm and the sea</strong> is also the motif of a myth from Ras-Shamra in Ugarit, which can be dated to the same period as Enuma elish. Did the East influence the West, or vice versa? Jacobsen proposes that the <strong>motif originated in the Mediterranean environment rather than in Babylon</strong>, because the sea is not a part of everyday life in Babylon, whereas it is in Ugarit. Finally, Jacobsen proposes that the motif was brought to Babylon late, with the Amorites.</p>

        <p>Jacobsen’s article examines what <strong>religious dramas</strong> were meant to achieve, and the ways their meaning changed over time in Babylon. He considers the older materials regarding fertility dramas, especially the Sacred Marriage Drama, and the first millenium remnants of the fertility dramas and the Battle Drama.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sacred Marriage Drama</strong> is found in the cult of Tammuz/Dumuzi attested in protoliterate times in Uruk. Jacobsen proposes the existence of three other fertility dramas involving processions, based on textual fragments that seem to suggest that they were &laquo;scripts&raquo; for a performance. Jacobsen calls these the Mourning Drama, the Road of No Return Drama, and the Search and Fetching Drama. </p>
<p>In the first millenium, relevant information comes mostly from cultic calendars and commentaries. This information is difficult to interpret, and fertility dramas no longer hold center-stage.  Jacobsen advances only the hypothesis that the the &laquo;death and lament drama of Dumuzi seems very likely to have retained its purpose of strengthening emotional ties with the god—especially in the case of Dumuzi of the grain where the death of the god has in fact been brought about by his worshipers and where the rite of lament is therefore one of great ambivalence and covert guilt.&raquo; (p. 75).</p>
<p>There is however a new form of drama, the <strong>Battle drama</strong>. As Jacobsen argues elsewhere (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Jacobsen1968Battle">Jacobsen 1968 Battle</a>), it is unlikely that the Marduk-Tiamat battle derived from the everyday experience of Babylonians, and was probably imported. However, the battle between Babylon and the &laquo;Sealand&raquo;, <em>mat tamti</em>, was the chief conflict during the early half of the second millennium. This political-historical interpretation also explains why Enlil is given no role in <em>Enuma elish</em>: he represents the south, and therefore the enemy side. 
&laquo;Although in some cases rooted in older fertility dramas, this new form comes to be the preferred vehicle for a new <em>political</em> drama celebrating and reaffirming the birth of the nation as a divine achievement that was from the beginning, in mythical time.&raquo; (p. 77).</p>

        <p>The article proposes a new interpretation and contextualization of the introductory lines of <em>Atrahasis</em>. After having discussed the terms <em>i-lu</em> and <em>a-wi-lum</em> on the basis of other occurrences within the text itself, Jacobsen investigates the context of the first 6 lines of the poem and takes into consideration, in particular, the meaning of the Akkadian term <strong><em>dullum</em></strong> in «its specialized sense of corvée, a sense otherwise attested in Old Babylonian only in Elam.» (p. 116). 
In Jacobsen&rsquo;s view, the term <em>dullum</em> is made more vivid by the image of the work-basket which parallels it in ll. 2-4: he proposes that ancient authors attributed to <em>dullum</em> a meaning that went beyond a purely objective description, but that rather aimed to describe toe psychological effect of the imposed work. «In so doing the poet skillfully develops, as it were, aspects inherent in the objectively descriptive terms he has just used: <em>dullum</em> is now given its meaning &ldquo;misery&rdquo;» (p. 117)</p>

        <p>The contribution reconstructs the very idea of <strong>Mesopotamian creation</strong> (mainly of humankind) as it is described in Sumerian and Akkadian sources. The author starts with the analysis of one tablet (<strong>KAR I, 4</strong>), moving to find comparisons with other texts, investigating the role of the primeval gods in the act of the creation, the mode and aim of the creation itself, the Mesopotamian view of the universe, and the concepts of <strong>‘order’ vs. ‘chaos’</strong>, hypothesizing also a ritual context for such a text.</p>
<p>&laquo;One of the crucial questions of mankind is certainly where he comes from and where he goes to, namely the origin of mankind. The monotheistic understanding of <strong>creation</strong> of mankind employs the idea that man is God’s chosen creature on earth whereas in Darwinism man is depicted as a glorious outcome of a long-term evolution. … However the Mesopotamian people who had no eschatology in their religious concepts went further and asked: What did gods do before they created humankind? … The purpose of this paper is to analyze the tablet KAR I, 4 (VAT 9307) which is a literary composition concerning creation, philologically and contextually, and attempt to place it into the long Mesopotamian literary tradition in terms of religious concepts entailed in creation myths&raquo; (from author’s introduction on p. 9].</p>
<p>The thesis focuses on the analysis of tablet <strong>KAR I, 4</strong> = VAT (<a href="https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/vorderasiatisches-museum/home/">Berlin</a>. The tablet and its content are described and interpreted by the author in his conclusion: </p>
<p>&laquo;KAR I, 4 (VAT 9307) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Assyrian_Empire"><strong>Middle Assyrian</strong></a> clay tablet which is found at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal">Library of Ashurbanipal</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh"><strong>Nineveh</strong></a>. It bears a bilingual text, Akkadian and Sumerian, written in three columns. … The Sumerian creation account can be seen as an <strong>etiological myth</strong> which explains the creation of the universe and of humankind and <strong>establishing the order of the universe</strong> by the gods present, particularly on the Sumerian pantheon. An analogical and structural comparative analysis of the myth with some other Sumerian and Akkadian manuscripts leads us to conclude that KAR I, 4 is a literary composition which transmits particularly common themes concerning creation and the world order associated with some other Mesopotamian myths, as well as in the monotheistic realm. … It may be seen either as a <strong>school composition</strong> paraphrastic, a kind of text with commentary which aims to teach the pupils the cosmogony with a semantic tool (such as gods’ names and professions), or a <strong>reference book for extispicy</strong>&raquo; (p. 65).</p>

        <p>This article examines the problems raised by traditional definitions of magic and divination and re-evaluates the ways in which the Western world has viewed &lsquo;magic&rsquo; as part of a series of dichotomies: religion vs. magic, science vs. magic. The author shows a particular attention towards ancient and modern terminology: for example, she highlights that the very term &lsquo;magic&rsquo; is derived from the classical world and mostly expresses a Hellenic worldview. She suggests, instead, to look at the original and specific terms used to refer to magic and divination so as to gain an insight into their specific sociological and historical context.</p>
<p>According to Jeffrey, to study magic and divination implies to witness the history of a paradigm shift. These categories, instead of being considered within their own original context, have often been taken on the worldview of the Western world: she argues that the Greeks of the classical period might be held responsible for having introduced a polemic against magic. Religion and magic must instead be considered as part of a wider system of intermediation and interconnection between the spheres of nature, human, animal, vegetal and mineral. Indeed, Jeffrey states that, in the ancient Near East, magic and religion were part of the cosmic order of the world. As a result, &laquo;In the ancient Near East, the term &lsquo;magic&rsquo; has little value from an &lsquo;etic&rsquo; perspective, and a better definition can only be an &lsquo;emic&rsquo; one, as &lsquo;intermediation&rsquo; practices that relate to the wider cosmological worldview of the ancient Near East.&raquo; (p. 689)</p>

        <p><em>Chapter 3</em> of the volume <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Puech1976Storia">Puech 1976 Storia</a> (by Raymond Jestin) displays the basic concepts of <strong>Sumerian religion</strong>, dealing with the actual perception of religion in historical times, the pantheon, clergy, cults and ceremonies, mythology, prayer, and magic.</p>
<p>Firstly, the author expresses a <em>caveat</em>, since a precise definition of <strong>‘religion’</strong> in Sumerian culture is very difficult to be established, because of the lack of any structured text explaining the very concept and perception of religion at Sumer. An attempt in understanding can be grasped only by the analysis of archaeological remains and actual texts reporting hymns, prayers, and myths, at most.</p>
<p>The author bases his analysis on a precise <strong>methodology</strong>: since the Sumerian culture is so far from our modern mindset about religion (i.e., we deal with a <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm"><em>broken tradition</em></a>), the only way for scholars consists in enucleating some basic concept throughout the extant texts.</p>
<p>Specifically, the author describes the Sumerian notion of <strong>Afterlife</strong> as something not so well defined but anyhow based on the fundamental concept of <strong>‘fate/destiny’</strong>. </p>
<p>The religious experience of the Sumerians, is basically structured on the definition of a <strong>cosmic order</strong>, created at the beginning of the world, which must be observed and respected to reconnect the human sphere to that of the gods.</p>
<p>The concrete expressions of Sumerian <strong>religious thought</strong> is outlined in the <strong>pantheon</strong>, the hierarchic structure of the <strong>clergy</strong>, and the regulation of specific <strong>cultic activities</strong>. What can be understood is that the Sumerian religion was basically addressed to the observation of specific ritual activities, festivals, and celebrations, which granted the conservation of the aforementioned <strong>cosmic order</strong>.  </p>
<p>[This contribution helps in tracing the basic concepts of Sumerian religious belief and its actual cultic practice. The contribution places as the fundamental bedrock of Sumerian religion the observance and conservation of the cosmic ‘order’ established by the gods at the creation of the world. This concept of ‘order’, governing both the divine and human behaviour, can be slightly compared to G. Buccellati’s notion of the ‘absolute’ (see specifically <em>Chapter 1</em>, <em>Sections 1-2</em> and <em>Chapter 3</em>, <em>Section 4</em>).]</p>

        <p>Johnston&rsquo;s article has quite an ambitious goal: to offer a comparative analysis of Babylonian and Greek poetry and theology, mostly through an analisys of two literary works - the Babylonian <em>Poem of the Righteous Sufferer</em> (dated to the late second millennium BCE), and the so-called <em>Elegy to the Muses</em> (fragment 13 West, probably composed in the sixth century BCE by the Athenian statesman and poet Solon). In particular, the author aims to «show that in the two poems, shifts in the identity and perspective of the poetic voice play a central role in theological argumentation, enabling the speaker to act out, or perform, a vision of humanity and the divine in a way that could intersect with, and potentially inflect, the beliefs and opinions of individuals.» (p. 64).</p>
<p>Both literary works reflect on crucial theological questions, concerning divine justice, human suffering and the possibility of obtaining knowledge and wisdom – and they do so within the framework of an elaborate poetic structure. Thus, Johnston says, they operate both as vehicles for theological thought and as literary artefacts.</p>

        <p>&laquo;The sacred marriage ceremony from ancient Mesopotamia is one of the most dramatic ways of conceptualizing the relationship between king and gods known from the ancient world. According to a number of literary texts, kings from the late third and early second millennia &ndash; and perhaps even earlier &ndash; consummated a ritual union with Inanna, the goddess of love and war. Given the literary nature of our evidence, this ceremony may have been only an intellectual construct, rather than an event in real life. Irrespective of this, however, it remains a major source, not only for early Mesopotamian religious thought in general, but for ideas of kingship in particular&raquo; (p. 291).</p>
<p>[The author discusses in this paper the <strong>political role of the sacred marriage ceremony for the legitimation of kingship in ancient Mesopotamia</strong> (as a way of transmission of power from the goddess to the king), presenting the specific example of a hymn, see <a href="https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr2531.htm">ETCSL</a>, of the period of Iddin-Dagan, third king of the dynasty of Isin (ca. 1910-1890 BC, short chronology).]</p>

        <p>W. Keller presents in this book an attempt of reconstruction of the historical milieu of the Bible (both for the Old and the New Testament), trying to retrace clues to prove the historicity of the Biblical accounts, on the base of archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East and Egypt. </p>
<p>The author tries to prove the historical truthfulness of the Bible by using a comparative approach based on archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East. He examines the major cycles dedicated to the patriarchs, the kings, and the exile.</p>
<p>For instance, <em>Chapter 1</em> (<em>Section 2</em>) deals with the story of Joseph, stressing a possible origin from an Egyptian text called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_Two_Brothers">‘Tale of Two Brothers’</a>, attested on <a href="https://archive.org/stream/papyrusdorbineyb00britrich#page/n5/mode/2up">papyrus D’Orbiney</a> = <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA10183-1">BM EA 10183</a> (English translation in Lichtheim 1976, vol. 2, pp. <a href="http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Lichtheim1976_203-211.pdf">203-211</a>). </p>
<p>[This book is considered as a classic example of the attempt of demonstrating the historical truthfulness of the Bible on the base of a comparative approach based on archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East and Egypt. The author’s approach, although criticisable and questionable to some extent, is a good stimulus to rethink about the <a href="https://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_criticism_osborne.html">historical-critical method</a> in the analysis of the Bible. The author presents a different opinion from that expressed by G. Buccellati in his volume; while the Keller recognizes a stream of tradition from the Late-Babylonian culture during the period of the Israelite exile at Babylon (an idea similar to that of <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Liverani2009Oltre">Liverani 2009 Oltre</a>, who is even more radical defining the Bible as an ‘invented story’), Buccellati prefers to reconnect these patriarchal traditions to a previous period (ca. 19th-17th cent. BC), namely that of the peregrination of Israel in the Middle-Euphratean steppes and their consequent contacts with Amorite people.]</p>

        <p>One of the most characteristic structures at Urkesh is indeed represented by the underground <strong>necromantic pit</strong> called <em>ābi</em> [see <a href="http://urkesh.org/MZ/A/A12/UGR/-frame.htm">Urkesh website</a>].</p>
<p>This paper investigates in detail the possible function of such a structure, discovered in the 1999 campaign in <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/89-A12.htm"><strong>Area A12</strong></a> of the <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm"><strong>Royal Palace</strong></a> and provisionally labelled as <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm"><strong><em>underground structure W</em></strong></a>, dated between 2300 BC and 2100 BC. </p>
<p>After a general introduction to the topic, <em>paragraph 2</em> describes the structure itself, its architecture (the rounded chamber, the squared room and the nature of the accumulations within the pit) and the major finds (most noteworthy, the <strong>anthropomorphic vessel</strong> <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/CERAMICS/texts/C3/D/A12.0108.htm">A12.108</a> (cf. <a href="http://urkesh.org/attach/Buccellati%202001%20Uberlegungen.pdf">Buccellati and Kelly-Buccellati 2001</a>), the inscribed sealing <a href="http://urkesh.org/mz/a/XVW/UNIT-TN/A12-i.htm">A12.82</a> (see pictures under item’s no.) and animal bones (see <a href="http://urkesh.org/attach/Di%20Martino%202005.pdf">Di Martino 2005</a> for the analysis of <strong>faunal remains</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 3</em> faces the challenge of <strong>interpretation</strong>, understanding the structure on the base of ancient written sources (mostly Hurrian and Hittite texts, quoting the term <strong><sup>(d)</sup><em>ābi</em> </strong>) and archaeological comparisons with similar structures (interpreted as <strong>KASKAL.KUR</strong>) at Ḫattuša and (possibly) at Yazılıkaya.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 4</em> further strengths the interpretation of the structure as a <strong>Hurrian <em>ābi</em></strong>, describing the possible <strong>nocturnal rituals</strong> that could take place within the pit. </p>
<p><em>Paragraph 5</em> investigates the <strong>historical meaning of the rituals</strong> performed in the <em>ābi</em>: <strong>necromantic practices</strong> are attested in Mesopotamian and Anatolian sources (and in the Bible, too) and similar cultic activities were acted in the area of the <em>ābi</em> (also including the mudbrick platform in Area X, for which see e.g. <a href="http://urkesh.org/EL-MZ/Buccellati_2005_Monumental_Urban_Complex_-_SCCNH_15.pdf">Buccellati 2005</a>) to worship <strong>chthonian deities</strong>: thus, the <strong>triple equation Area A12 = <em>ābi</em> = KASKAL.KUR</strong>, as a <strong>passage to the Netherworld</strong> seems to be validated by both textual and archaeological evidence.</p>

        <p>«The history of emotion is an important interdisciplinary research field, not least because it touches fundamental questions about the distinction between psychobiology-based universals und sociocultural, path-dependent and thus relative peculiarities. Conceptual incongruities between what is today understood as emotion and various views on emotions in antiquity should not distract from the fact that, while emotions do have history, they substantially belong to all human experience as such. Visual media and images open perspectives for transcultural research that differ from the testimony of texts. Their study can thus make a major contribution to a better understanding of emotions in the Ancient Near East. How where gestures, body postures, facial expressions etc. visualized in images from Mesopotamia, the Levant and Egypt and what role does the visualization play in communicating emotions? The first part of the present volume takes concrete examples as a starting point and discusses the fundamental question whether or not emotions were represented and can thus be studied in Ancient Near Eastern art. Approaches and arguments are controversial: Some authors argue that there are no visualizations of emotions, but only of cultural roles and ritual embodiments. Their view is contrasted by other contributors, who assume that one may detect non-verbal expressions hiding emotions in visual representations and that it is crucial to specify the appropriate tools and methodologies to interpret them in an adequate way. The second part offers five additional theoretical reflexions from comparative, linguistic and arthistorical perspectives. With such a broad interdisciplinary approach including Assyriology, Egyptology, Near Eastern archaeology and Hebrew Bible/Old Testament studies, the volume offers a large panorama of the most important research positions on a fundamental topic.» (editor&rsquo;s summary)</p>

        <p>In this article, Kitz questions the two categories in which the practice of prophecy is normally separated by modern scholars: namely, prophecy based on &ldquo;technical/ operational/deductive&rdquo; methods (such as divination by livers, stars, and smoke), and prophecy described as &ldquo;intuitive,&rdquo; &ldquo;direct,&rdquo; or &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; (such as oneiromancy). The author&rsquo;s goal is to provide a preliminary working model for the analysis of procedures of divination and, while doing so, she also intends to locate biblical prophecy among other techniques of divination, particularly by comparing the phaenomenon with prophecy as evidenced by Mesopotamian texts.</p>
<p>Kitz identifies one main difference between biblical and Mesopotamian prophecy: while the Hebrew Bible strongly advocates divinely inspired interpretation of heavenly generated signs, in Mesopotamia the emphasis on this is less explicit. «Thus, whereas in Mesopotamia the signs remained divine in origin, their interpretation could be attributed, in large degree, to human skill and to a familiarity with the appropriate documents of divination. This difference in emphasis suggests that the Hebrew Bible may not necessarily dismiss the efficacy of divination <em>per se</em>, but rather any human attempt, unaided by Yahweh alone, to interpret the implications of divine activity.» (p. 24).</p>
<p>Similarly to what Buccellati discusses in his volume, also Kitz believes that the contrast between the biblical and Mesopotamian view ultimately stems from the very conception of divinity: if the basic assumption of prophecy is that all divine action causes material reaction, such a fundamental tenet assumes that the god(s) is/are the activating directors of the earthly world, in which individuals can function as their agents. At p. 31 of this article, the author provides a very useful chart that organizes and correlates the several divination methods that were in use in antiquity.</p>
<p>Kitz, with several examples taken both from Near Eastern sources and the Hebrew Bible, discusses the different roles that were attributed to those who experienced the divine stimulus that produced the dream, vision, or words and the individual who deciphered those signs. Indeed, the two functions need not have been performed by the same individual in neither society: being a divine instrument, through whom experiences in dreams, actions, and/or messages were produced, was a possibility open to everyone - but the role of interpreter was the more decisive component process, inasmuch as interpretation could give a sign legitimacy and confirm the divine origins.</p>

        <p>Kitz analyzes curses in the Ancient Near East from a religious and social perspective, with an approach which is similar to the one used by Buccellati in his volume. She highlights how cursing &ldquo;importuned&rdquo; patron deities as well as personal deities, to injure others so that the well-being of the person or community who cursed might be sustained.</p>
<p>Kitz highlights the cultural difference between the ancient and modern perceptions of curses: in the Near East, a curse did not necessarily imply an offensive language nor the presence of insults. Rather, curses aimed at soliciting a god (or many gods) to harm a person, place or thing: in Mesopotamia, thus, <strong>&ldquo;since curses are wishes, they are, therefore, petitionary prayers to the deities. &hellip; To petition a deity to injure another is to seek a blessing for oneself. &hellip; Thus, many curses may be properly viewed as indirect blessings, a fact that may have contributed to their popularity in the Ancient Near East.&rdquo;</strong> (p. 616)</p>
<p>Interestingly, this article offers examples from both the Bible and the Near East, discussing similarities and differences between the two cultural words.</p>

        <p>This article begins by giving a brief explanation by Biblical scholar Yehezkel Kauffmann, who argues that the priestly cult and the activities carried out within the &laquo;temple&raquo; were done so in silence and totally devoid of verbalized spells or prayer. He suggests that all activities which were not carried out in &laquo;silence&raquo; happened outside the vicinity of the temple, and that &laquo;psalmody&raquo; was the creation of popular poets and singers who joined the Levite class; the &laquo;psalms&raquo; themselves were not part of any &laquo;sacrificial cult&raquo; or &laquo;priestly rites&raquo;. In response, Knohl utilizes examples from the &laquo;Second Temple period&raquo; that contradict the narrative of temples as &laquo;&lt;sanctuaries of silence&raquo;&gt;. In analyzing the religious attitudes behind the priestly class of the early Torah, Knohl reveals the development of a religious language that negates all previous pagan ideologies of the absolute. He suggests that priestly traditions are not mutually exclusive with any covenantal agreements, that they exist solely as reactionary to pagan customs. Knohl examines cultic acts in detail, searching for specific contexts wherein voice and prayer were permitted or deemed obligatory, noting discrepancies between what was considered pious yet non-compulsory to the citizen of &laquo;Israel&raquo;. Likening allegories to angels as silent servants of the divine, the expectation of silence was mirrored in the temple cults and dictated by the &laquo;Qumran sect&raquo;. After the destruction of the Second Temple, &laquo;silent prayer&raquo; became the religious imperative as a substitute for institutionalized worship. </p>

        <p>In this article, U. Koch tries to apply elements from cognitive theory of religion to shed light on a particular question posed by the Mesopotamian extispicy ritual: namely, why the remedy for an unfavourable extispicy was to perform another - up to three times in a row. The scholar also analyzes the (possible) existence of apotropaic or appeasement rituals to be performed alongside (or: to counterbalance) a negative extispicy. Looking at the primary sources from ancient Mesopotamia, Koch comes to the conclusion that «Whereas the letters and reports from Assyrian and Babyonian scholars demonstrate that aversive action in the form of various rituals, including <em>namburbis</em>, was not uncomon in connection with astrological omina, there is no similar evidence that apotropaic or appeasement rituals were ever performed in connection with extispicy. <strong>Aversive action in response to unfavourable extispicy is never explicitly mentioned</strong> in the scholarly correspondence of the Neo-Assyrian kings, nor to my knowledge are they attested to in texts from the second millennium» (p. 46).</p>
<p>Still, Koch detects an interesting similarity between the extispicy and the <em>namburbi</em> ritual: they were both described as a judgment. She mentions the case of one extispicy ritual in which the diviner is instructed to &ldquo;perform a sacrifice, establish a verdict&rdquo; - while in another one the diviner is told to &ldquo;sit on the seat of the judge&rdquo; in front of the gods of Justice, Shamash and Adad. The place in which the ritual takes place is itself called &ldquo;the place of decision by extispicy&rdquo; or &ldquo;the place of judgment&rdquo; (for precise details and bibliographical references for these texts cf. pp. 51-52). «<strong>Within the divinatory discipline the metaphor of the court of law is most consequently and consistenly used in extispicy, and the extispicy ritual actually <em>mise en scène</em> </strong>.» (p. 52). Koch explains this phaenomenon with the «conceptual blending between the juridical domain and the sacred domain.» (p. 53). Just as a court case implies two intentional agents - accuser and accused, or victim and culprit - also in rituals the actions and intentions of the human and divine party are laid open to judgment, and the divine judge is asked to rule in favor of the client.</p>

        <p>This article deals with the anonymity of cuneiform literature, citing only two examples; <strong>Kabti-ilani-Marduk</strong> who composed the <strong>Era Myth</strong> (although claimed to be received through <strong>prophecy</strong>) and <strong>Saggil-kinam-ubbib</strong>, author of the <strong>Babylonian Theodicy</strong>. Babylonian and Assyrian <strong>traditional literature</strong> including <strong>omen</strong> and <strong>medical</strong> texts can be ascribed to &ldquo;successive generations of storytellers and scribes&rdquo; who have amended, redacted and altered works throughout Mesopotamia&rsquo;s history. Literature is thought to have been buried in <strong>Sippar</strong> during the deluge, and subsequently rediscovered, attributing all authorship to antediluvian sages. Lambert considers the transference of authorship as a form of <strong>ancestry</strong> practice that should be investigated in Mesopotamian literature beyond the &ldquo;X son of Y&rdquo; filial relationship ties. Lambert surveys the change in use of ancestral names from the <strong>Babylonian</strong> period to the <strong>Seleucid</strong>, citing significant events or epochs where different names are featured prominently and relate ancestry to gods, cities, and ancient scribes. 
    This article attempts to trace lineage of individuals through <strong>titles</strong>, making it a relevant resource for those interested in the function of monikers, especially in relation to the appropriation of ancestor titles. The latter half of the article deals with <strong>canonicity</strong>, which in the case of Mesopotamia is intimately tied to the antediluvian <strong>sages</strong> and <strong>patriarchs</strong>, who are responsible for the totality of knowledge. Lambert suggests this point presents a parallel with the <strong>Torah</strong>.</p>

        <p>In the opening paragraphs of this article, Lambert defines morality as follows: &ldquo;Morals in any age can be divided into two categories: the standards actually practised among the mass of the population, and the ideals proclaimed by thinkers or prophets&rdquo; (p. 185). He investigates Mesopotamian literature, looking for evidence of morality: in particular, he believes that two types of written sources may be particularly relevant, namely direct moral exhortations, and hymns which contain sections devoted to ethics (such as the hymn to Shamash, Buccellati&rsquo;s App. 3). Other texts are used in this paper as examples of indirect materials throwing light on Mesopotamian moral standards (<em>Shurpu</em>, legal documents, law codes).</p>
<p>Lambert thinks that from these texts (which are often made up of short mutually independent paragraphs, such as could easily be committed to memory) one might obtain a glimpse of the moral standards of ordinary people. He believes that morality stemmed from the very idea of Mesopotamian cosmology: the universe had been created by the gods, and humanity came into being with the almost only goal to serve the divine world. Therefore, to fulfil the divine commands was considered right, while neglecting to do so implied committing a sin. Any punishment or reward for bad or pious behaviour was expected to take place in the earthly life, since in ancient Mesopotamia there was no hope for any bliss in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Not only the physical universe was a divine creation, but every aspect of human society was equally a divine gift (such as kingship, which &ldquo;descended from heaven&rdquo;). This theory had social implications: if all human institutions had been created by the gods, to disregard or attempt to alter them would have been a sin.</p>

        <p>In this brief yet stimulating article, Lambert investigates the relationship of myth and ritual in ancient Mesopotamia, by discussing several case-studies and contextualizing them in their ancient religious and social contexts.</p>
<p>Lambert begins with an analysis of literary texts, namely <em>Atrahasis</em> and <em>Enuma Elish</em> - questioning the existence of aetiologies for ritual practices, and asking whether these epics (the <em>Enuma Elish</em> in particular) had been written for cultic use. To this last question, he gives a negative answer: &laquo;<strong>there is clearly a myth presupposed in the rites of the Akitu house</strong>, a public ritual of Babylon. But <strong>the written form of the myth known to us does not seem to have been written for recitation in a ritual at all</strong>. This use seems to be secondary, and many have taken place once every month&raquo;.</p>
<p>Lambert then goes on investigating incantations (&laquo;it must be observed that only a small minority of incantations contain myths, so that there was nothing special, on the magic level, in a myth&raquo;) and texts bearing ritual instructions and commentaries (highlighting the importance of the identifications, described in these texts, between the mythical events and the acts which were performed in rituals). He infers, then, that &laquo;<strong>the Babylonian school of Myth and Ritual was occupied in explaining traditional rituals as reenactments of traditional myths</strong> &hellip; <strong>in all cases alike there is the fundamental presupposition that myths (&hellip;) were conceived to be recurring at regular intervals in the world in which the Babylonian authors lived</strong>&raquo;.</p>

        <p>This article documents the development of several strands of Mesopotamian <strong>polytheism</strong>, which present different numbers of gods and also show the absorption of some lesser gods into more important gods. One example, a short text which lists 14 gods as different aspects of Marduk, was brought to general attention by Friedrick Delitzsch. It &laquo;has indeed every claim to present <strong>Marduk as a monotheistic god</strong>. The deities being identified with him are major ones of the pantheon.&raquo; (p. 198). </p>
<p>However, this list represents only one opinion in the ancient world, one which did not win out in the end. According to Lambert, &laquo;while the attempts to tidy up a host of minor gods and overlapping among the bigger ones were commendable, this was not enough to adjust a sophisticated polytheism to the reality of nature. And the one attempt to see all power in the hands of one god, Marduk, though now vindicated in principle by a scientific understanding of the workings of the universe, did not win the support which it deserved.&raquo; (p. 199). </p>

        <p>In this article, Lambert offers a condensed synthesis of the ancient Mesopotamian religion. This text is interesting because of the approach that it uses, as it is described by the author in the opening paragraph that aims to justify the wording used for the title: &laquo;The terms &ldquo;superstition&rdquo;, &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; and &ldquo;theology&rdquo; have been deliberately chosen as raw, crude terms to avoid a powerful terminology which would take over the subject by imposing its own concepts on the discussion. By &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; the emotional content of religion is meant ; &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; is used to refer to the rational element in religion (with an implicit objection to those who might wish to assert that abstract thought began with the Greeks) ; and &ldquo;theology&rdquo; refers to the amalgam of these emotional and rational elements.&raquo; (p. 116) </p>
<p>While discussing Mesopotamian religion on the basis of Sumerian and Akkadian texts, Lambert highlights some interesting facts: firstly, that there is virtually no duplication in the Sumerian city patron gods - a fact that he justifies with a well-thought organization of the pantheon made <em>ab origine</em> by Sumerian theologians. </p>
<p>Then, while noting that gods with greater cosmic importance (such as those linked to the sky and the earth) were more important than those concerned with human crafts, the scholar suggests that this might have been due to both the strength of a millennia-long tradition and &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; on the part of theologians. </p>
<p>Lambert also discusses the fact that by both theological thinking and the power of priests of major temples, the total number of different gods was diminished over the centuries - one consequence of this fact being an increase in the names of the main deities. Taking Marduk as an example, Lambert notes how in the late-second and first millennium BCE no less than fifty names were attributed to that god - consisting of the sum of his own names and epithets, and of names of those gods whom he had absorbed by being equated with them by Mesopotamian theologians. As a final step, Marduk by the late second millennium had become head of the pantheon, resulting in a kind of monotheism. Lambert also highlights, however, that this was quite a unique phenomenon: other gods always remained separate beings.</p>
<p>Lambert, then, tackles the issue of whether the Mesopotamian anthropomorphic divine representations were preceded by a theriomorphic stage. He analyses symbols used to represent gods in various types of artistic forms, and he comes to the conclusion that supporting evidence of a pre-anthropomorphic stage of religion is lacking.</p>

        <p>This volume summarizes Lambert&rsquo;s decades-long studies on Sumerian and Akkadian creation myths. It contains the transliterated and translated text of the Babylonian epic of creation <em>Enuma Eliš</em>; an in-depth study of different aspects of the epic in the framework of Mesopotamian religious history (including the organization of the universe, of the earth and of the divine pantheon); the edition of 16 more Sumerian and Akkadian literary texts which deal with the topic of the creation; the theogonies of Enlil and Anu.</p>
<p>Lambert&rsquo;s volume addresses several topics which are relevant for Buccellati&rsquo;s discussion of ancient Mesopotamian religion - topics which are mostly elicited from a careful reading of the Sumerian and Akkadian original written sources. </p>
<p>Particularly interesting is the issue of the decreeing of destinies and of the Tablet of Destinies. In Mesopotamian literature, several gods are said to decree destinies, either as single deities (mostly Enlil, whose prestige had always been associated with the &ldquo;determining of destinies&rdquo; as discussed at p. 257 and 304) or as a community. At the end of the cosmic battle described in <em>Enuma Eliš</em>, however, in the newly established order of the divine pantheon &ldquo;the Seven gods of destinies were appointed to give decisions&rdquo; (line VI, 81). The same seven gods of destinies are almost certainly meant by &ldquo;the Seven great Anunnaki&rdquo; mentioned in <em>Atra-hasis</em> line I 5 (cf. pp. 193-194). [Lambert&rsquo;s survey of literary texts related to the &ldquo;Tablet of Destinies&rdquo; is relevant for Buccellati&rsquo;s volume, as it describes the ancient Mesopotamian&rsquo;s perception of the decreeing the fate and the concept of Destiny itself].</p>
<p>Lambert also addresses the topic of the ancient Near Eastern concept of cosmology, noting that the idea that originally heaven and earth had been joined, or were closely connected, is very widespread in world mythology. Then, it tackles the issue of the organization of how, after the separation of the two, the realms were organized according to the ancient Mesopotamian perception. The ordering of the heavens as described in <em>Enuma Eliš</em> mostly focuses on fixing the calendar rather than in astronomy <em>per se</em>: Lambert considers a noteworthy feature of this part of <em>Enuma Eliš</em> the fact that the topic is addressed scientifically, with very little reference to mythology (p. 172).</p>
<p>Lambert, then, deals with the organization of the heavenly bodies as described in <em>Enuma Eliš</em> - particularly, with the tripartite scheme based on the cosmic locations of Anu (heaven), Enlil (earth), and Ea (Aps˚) as the three main levels of the universe (pp. 196-197). The scholar also notes that in ancient Mesopotamian religion, besides dwelling in their temples deities were thought to have an other-wordly home, above or beneath the world of men; yet, the scheme described in <em>Enuma Eliš</em> gives Marduk no other home than Esagil: thus, the city of Babylon could boast a prestige which no other city could match and it became the place in which from time to time the gods from above and below would assemble.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the myths edited in Part III deserves a special mention: it is Enmešarra&rsquo;s Defeat, discussed at pp. 281-298. The story shares many parallels to <em>Enuma Eliš</em>, namely a rebellion against Marduk lead by Enmešarra and his seven sons who are then defeated and put into prison. Also in this text, there is a description of a cosmic reorganization. Lambert&rsquo;s discussion of the rather obscure section iv 18-30 (paralleled in v 18-26), deserves to be quoted in full: &laquo;<strong>A voice cries from heaven with fateful announcements.</strong> It is paralleled more easily in the Bible and the Rabbinic bath qÙl than in cuneiform. In a monotheistic world, the supreme and only god is of course responsible, but <strong>in a polytheistic world one asks, Whose voice? The only possible answer is that the voice speaks for the Destinies-a set of regulations governing the universe, including the gods</strong>. If any one god had been responsible, this would surely have been stated. Thus, the very anonymity of the voice serves to reinforce the certainty of the matter announced. The first of the two sections states that Uruk and Nippur are to be devastated. These are the towns of Anu and Enlil, and since the author seems to ignore Ea completely, this meant the end of the old Neo-Sumerian trinity of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, so leaving Babylon and Marduk to take over their previous hegemony. Whatever the truth may turn out to be, this announcement is one of the most spiteful passages of Babylonian literature reflecting inter-cult rivalry. The second announcement asserts Marduk&rsquo;s absolute supremacy in the universe&raquo; (pp. 282-283).</p>
<p>[Strikingly, such unique aspect of the myth has not been discussed in detail by other scholars: Lambert&rsquo;s interpretation, though intriguing, is still very doubtful due to the lack of any similar passages in all the other ancient Near Eastern literary texts known so far.]</p>

        <p>The paper describes some <strong>peculiar gestures in Mesopotamian prayer</strong>, linking the actual words of the prayer with specific actions, gestures, and attitudes helping the prayers to obtain the attention of the gods. The archaeological approach of the author, analysing artefacts such as cylinder seals and statues, helps to better understand throughout visual images the actual realisation of gestures described in literary sources.</p>
<p>[The author specifically describes some gestures such as the position of the hands (‘the lifting of the hand’), the act of kissing a religious image, and the prostration of the face (the Akkadian <em>lapan appi</em>, lit. ‘the touching of the nose’), finding similar attitudes also in the Bible, in Hittite culture, and in classical religious texts.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;The primary purpose of this study is to increase understanding of <strong>Sumerian sacred marriage</strong> by approaching it from a <strong>comparative perspective</strong>. More generally, it is hoped that the study will illustrate the fruitfulness of the comparative approach for the study of Sumerian religion and royal ideology and that it will prove useful to the other fields of study whose sources were used as the comparative evidence.
The comparative evidence includes sources from six different fields of study: Assyriology (first and second millennium love lyrics and rituals), Biblical studies (The Song of Songs), Classics (Graeco-Roman philosophies, Chaldean Oracles), Gnostic studies, Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) and Indology (Hindu rites and myths). Ancient Egyptian and Ugaritic evidence is also used&raquo; (from author’s description of the book on <a href="https://www.eisenbrauns.org/books/titles/978-951-45-9058-0.html">editor’s webpage</a>).</p>
<p>[This volume collects a series of Sumerian rituals connected to the ceremony of the <strong>sacred marriage</strong>, offering comparisons with other Mesopotamian attestations of the same religious performance.]</p>

        <p>This article examines relationships between <strong>Hebrew laments of the individual</strong> and <strong>Akkadian suilla-prayers</strong> with an emphasis on their respective <strong>invocations</strong> and <strong>hymnic prologues</strong>. In doing so, Lenzi seeks to disprove the historical basis of comparison dominating the field of religious studies in the Near East, arguing in favor of a more nuanced anthropological methodology. He observes a distinction in length of invocations, noting that  the Hebrew Psalter&rsquo;s laments of the individual are notably shorter than the Akkadian suilla-prayers. This is attributed to the &ldquo;hymnic&rdquo; quality of the Akkadian texts. Lenzi outlines the various positions of notable scholars with respect to their interpretation of the function of the hymnic prologue and the shorter Hebrew invocation, noting a history of &ldquo;theological generalizations that imply the superiority of Israelite prayer&rdquo;. Ultimately, Lenzi offers new theoretical approaches that stress an examination of the sociocultural context and shifts attention, as given in ritual studies, on <strong>social proximity</strong> and <strong>formalization</strong>. </p>

        <p>&laquo;Recent work on the <strong>prophetic phenomenon</strong> in the ancient Near East has mainly focused on the Paleo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian eras as well as, naturally, on the biblical corpus, often with a comparative perspective between these different areas. The second half of the 2nd millennium BC received relatively little attention, as mentions of prophets are rare and scattered there. In fact, in texts from this period, from four different sites, we find mentions of people who are or could be prophets. None of their attestations clearly show them in the exercise of their inspired activities; but these individuals are designated by various terms: āpilu, maḫḫû, and nābû, all already known at the time of Amorite with the sure or probable meaning of “prophet”. The following study gathers the references of the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, then compares them to the Paleo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian texts, to see if a translation by “prophet” is at least possible&raquo; (from p. 21; English translation from French by mDP).</p>
<p>[This paper tries to cross the boundaries between Israelite sources, basically the Old Testament, and the ancient Near Eastern document about the phaenomenon of prophetism, in search of specific Akkadian terms referring to prophets and prophetesses in second-millennium Mesopotamia.]</p>

        <p>In the introductory pages of this volume, the author declares his ambitious goal of offering <strong>a history of Israel free from any influence deriving from the biblical story</strong> and his willingness to bring the story of the birth of Istrael back to its historical reality. Liverani roots his research on the most recent discoveries of textual and literary criticism, also making use of the contributions provided by archaeology and epigraphy, and on the basis of the modern historiographic methodology and criteria.
Starting from the observation that the biblical story is the result of a late elaboration, <strong>Liverani positions the textual materials back to the time of their writing, reconstructs the evolution of political and religious ideologies across various historical periods, and firmly places the history of Israel in its Near-Eastern context</strong>. As a result, the evenemential, political and social history discussed in this volume follows the thread of modern reconstruction instead of that of the biblical narration. In particular, Liverani chooses a bipartite structure for his book: in the first one, that he calls <strong>&ldquo;A Normal History&rdquo;</strong> and in which he discusses events that took place from the Late Bronze Age (14th century B.C.) to the Babylonian imperial conquest (6th century B.C.), he presents the story of the two kingdoms in the Palestinian area, whose experiences were similar to many other contemporary kingdoms that followed a similar development and were all destroyed by the Assyrian and Babylonian imperial conquest. In the second part of the volume, he describes <strong>&ldquo;An Invented History&rdquo;</strong> - which goes from the fall of Babylon and the edict of Cyrus (539 BC) to the mission of Ezra (4th century BC): in this section, he discusses the time and ways in which a huge and varied rewriting of previous history took place, in order to create the founding archetypes for the foundation of a nation (Israel) and a religion (Judaism) that would influence the entire course of subsequent history on a global scale.</p>

        <p>MacDonald&rsquo;s paper explicitly argues that &laquo;efforts to understand historically remote patterns of thought are driven away from their original meaning if the investigation focuses on reconstruction of concepts, instead of cognitive &lsquo;complexes&rsquo;.&raquo; (p. 82) Drawing on research conducted by previous scholars on the cultures of Ancient Greece, Israel, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Etruria, it applies comparative analyses of the semantic fields of spatial and temporal terms, and it investigates how these terms are shaped by their relation to the sphere of the sacred. </p>
<p>Through a textual and lexical analysis of the ancient cultures taken into consideration in this article, MacDonald challenges the long-standing, usually unexamined opposition between cyclical time and linear time - and he proposes to consider three super-ordinate timeframes - the cyclical, the linear and the static - each of which composed of lower-order cycles (days, lunar months, and seasons). </p>
<p>Then, the author highlights how neither in the Mesopotamian nor in the Egyptian documentary evidence can one find the concept of &ldquo;space&rdquo; - thus he infers that while studying these culture we should take into consideration not our moderns concepts, but rather the super-ordinate spatial frames which reflect better their cultures&rsquo; ideas about the structure of the world.</p>

        <p>This article has some ambitious goals: it opens with some remarks about anthropomorphism in religion as a whole, then it surveys the presence of various forms of anthropomorphism in Mesopotamian religion - also (but not exclusively) by analysing three Mesopotamian mythic compositions (<em>Enuma Elish</em>, <em>Anzu</em> and <em>Erra</em>). Finally, it widens the topic by comparing the Mesopotamian world with examples taken from the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p>Machinist identifies the origin of anthropomorphism in religion in the human need to bridge the gap existing with the divine sphere, which leads humans to use the experiences and the world they know to understand the divine: &ldquo;When this effort centers on <strong>understanding the divine through the human, we may speak of it as anthropomorphism</strong>&rdquo; (p. 67). Anthropomorphism, then, can take three shapes: 1. physical (the deity looks like a human or part of a human); 2. functional (the god/goddess behaves like a human); 3. emotional (the deity shows emotions that are normally found in humans).</p>
<p>Machinist provides an analysis of ancient Mesopotamian sources (both written and visual) looking for &ldquo;some possible guesses, if not conclusions, about the nature, representation, and conceptualization of divinity in Mesopotamia, and the place of anthropomorphism in it&rdquo; (p. 72). Interestingly, Machinist reviews the main theories on anthropomorphism in ancient Mesopotamia put forward by some of the most reknowned scholars, such as Jacobsen and Wiggerman.</p>
<p>In offering an analysis of the three Mesopotamian myths, the scholar comes to the conclusion that &ldquo;<strong>the borderline between anthropomorphism and non-anthropomorphism is regularly a fine and porous one</strong> (&hellip;) since we find both monster/demons and gods overlapping and sharing at a number of points in each other&rsquo;s properties. <strong>Furthermore, this borderline is for our myths not statically fine and porous; it is dynamically so</strong>&rdquo; (p. 95).</p>
<p>Machinist concludes his article with &ldquo;a modest look, by way of conclusion, at the Hebrew Bible. The latter represents, of course, a Near Eastern religio-literary tradition in contact, both directly and indirectly, with Mesopotamia&rdquo; (p. 95). He recognizes a mixture of anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic traits in the God of Israel, and investigates also the role of &ldquo;other gods&rdquo;, monsters and demons as they appear in the Bible.</p>

        <p>This volume offers a brief introduction to the religion of ancient Mesopotamia. 
The volume deals with many topics, as it is evidence from the aforementioned index: nevertheless, <strong>Chapter 1</strong> (<em>Preliminary Questions</em>) is particularly noteworthy in the definition of ancient Mesopotamian concepts of <strong>religion</strong> and its relationships with <strong>magic</strong>), <strong>polytheism</strong>/<strong>cosmotheism</strong> (vs. <strong>monotheism</strong>), and <strong>gods</strong>. As it is well-known, ancient Mesopotamians did not have a precise term to define <em>religion</em> and this concept needs to be understood and interpreted through its manifestations, i.e. the <strong>cults</strong> and <strong>mythological texts</strong>. Starting from the prehistorical period, mentioning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanidar_Cave">Shanidar Cave</a> (see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Trinkaus1983Shanidar">Trinkaus 1983 Shanidar</a>) and other pre-Neolithic and Neolithic sites in Anatolia and Mesopotamia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a> [see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Schmidt2011Costruirono">Schmidt 2011 Costruirono</a>], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük</a> [see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hodder2010Emergence">Hodder 2010 Emergence</a>], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%9F%C4%B1kl%C4%B1_H%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Aşikli Höyük</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neval%C4%B1_%C3%87ori">Nevalı Çori</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallan_%C3%87emi_Tepesi">Allan Çemi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho">Jericho</a>, Ja’adat al-Maghara [near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manbij">Manbij</a>], and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qermez_Dere">Qermez Dere</a>), the author retraces the paths towards the definition of a religious thought, later standardized in the historical period, after the foundation of the first cities in the Syro-Mesopotamian area, underlining the emergence of some specialistic figures (already in the preurban phase), such as the <em>medicine man</em> (defined as a <strong>shaman</strong>), and the evidence of early <strong>ancestor cults</strong>. </p>
<p>On pages 23 and 48, the author also proposes to define the ancient Mesopotamian religion system not only as a <strong>polytheism</strong> but even better as a <strong>cosmotheism</strong>, i.e. a system where deities are perceived as the manifestation or personification of the natural order (<em>cosmos</em>) of the world (as for <em>cosmotheism</em>, see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Assmann1998Moses">Assmann 1998 Moses</a>). </p>
<p>On pp. 25-27, the authors also discusses some particular archaeological methodologies (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Binford">Lewis Binford</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processual_archaeology"><em>New/Processual Archaeology</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Gordon_Childe">Vere Gordon Childe</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_archaeology">Marxist archaeology</a>), and theories on phenomenology (as those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a>), hard sciences, and neurosciences, applying them in the quest for a coherent definition Mesopotamian religious culture(s).    </p>
<p>[The book is very useful to get a general introduction to ancient Mesopotamian religion about many topics. Notwithstanding the briefness of the book, the author is able to condense in few pages many different themes on Mesopotamian religion, providing the reader with basic definitions of specific terms and with a historical discussion on theoretical approach on the topic.]</p>

        <p>This paper provides a useful assessment of the text known as the &ldquo;Sumerian King List&rdquo;, which is defined as &ldquo;a composition halfway between a literary text and a list proper, which deals with the history of kingship in Babylonia from the beginning of time to the early centuries of the second millennium BC.&rdquo; (p. 231).</p>
<p>Marchesi offers a remarkable collection of bibliography on this peculiar text, incuding reference to its <em>editio princeps</em> (by Jacobsen, dated 1839) and to many manuscripts published in more recent years. The Sumerian King List is fully acknowledged as a complex and composite literary work, with a long redactional history: it is indeed a document of exceptional interest in its providing modern readers with a reconstruction of the history of early Babylonia by the Babylonians themselves.</p>
<p>Marchesi highlights &ldquo;the absence of any theological speculation&rdquo; in this text, also proved by the fact that no deity plays a role in the story that it reveals. Similarly to what is stated by Buccellati in §16.5, Marchesi recognised that, indeed, kingship itself is considered as a &ldquo;divine entity&rdquo;: it descends from heaven, and as such it is considered as a divine institution. Still, from its descent on the earth onward kingship is trasferred from one city to the other exclusively as a consequence of military (i.e. human) events (p. 234).</p>

        <p>[Author&rsquo;s summary] The Assyrian king, as a representative on Earth of his tutelary deity, Aššur, was logically considered as his &ldquo;armed wing&rdquo;, and therefore the implement of the divine wrath, wrath which often resulted from the breaking by the vassal or the ally of the pact he had concluded with the king of Assyria. The royal Assyrian inscriptions as an ideological expression of world domination usually illustrate this punishment, but sometimes they mention military campaigns leading to forgiveness. Here we analyse two instances illustrating these two opposite attitudes. First, that of the &ldquo;impossible forgiveness&rdquo;, illustrated by the campaign of Assarhaddon against the kingdom of Šubria, where the opposing king tried unsuccessfully, by all means, to escape the Assyrian God&rsquo;s wrath. Then, that of the &ldquo;impossible revenge&rdquo; against the king of Tyre, Ba&rsquo;alu, to whom accordingly, for the sake of Real-politik, divine forgiveness was the logical outcome of the military expedition.</p>

        <p>[Author&rsquo;s summary] The Chronist speaks of divine wrath, but it is a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; wrath, deeply reflected and integrated into the dogma of retribution. This is not surprising in a historiographic work that enjoys a certain officialness. On the other hand, the notion of divine repentence is almost entirely lacking in the Chronist. He does however speak of YHWH as compassionate and merciful: He gives man a chance to repent and convert.</p>
<p>[The Chronist&rsquo;s view, as presented by Mathys, is that the <strong>divine will follows an immutable law</strong>: for YHWH to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; would be to act unjustly. He can however delay retribution, and thus give man the opportunity to repent and escape punishment.] </p>

        <p>In this article, published after &ldquo;Quando&rdquo; went to print, the author provides an interpretation of the development of Syria that shows greater continuity, and an earlier development of the sense of existence beyond the tomb, than has been thought in the past. Matthiae presents evidence that the <strong>cult of divinized ancestor kings does exist continuously from about 2400-2300 BCE to 900-720 BCE</strong> in Ebla. He presents five major reasons for this position.</p>
<p>First, there are two ritual texts from the Royal Archives of Ebla, which he dates to 2350-2300 BCE, dealing with enthroning a new king. Both rites mention divinized previous kings by name.</p>
<p>Second, there is a monumental tomb underneath the royal palace in Ebla, Hypogee G4, of the same era. Its presence indicates a change with respect to the textual tradition, which mentions burial outside of the city of Ebla. Not without some hesitation, Matthiae proposes that this change indicates, on the part of Ishar-Damu, an &ldquo;ideological revolution of the concept of royalty? to adhere to the tradition of the great Mesopotamian urban powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third piece of evidence can be found in three tombs at Tell Mardikh (1850-1700 BCE). One of these is very probably the tomb of king Immeya. A two-faced ritual talisman found in it &ldquo;summarizes the two essential moments of the assumption of the dead and divinized king among the royal ancestors who have become gods&rdquo;: the funeral banquet, and the ascension of the dead king to the heavens.</p>
<p>Fourthly, three poetic fragments (KTU 1.20-22) dealing with the Rapi&rsquo;uma are, in Matthaiae&rsquo;s estimation, to be understood as referring to divinized kings.</p>
<p>Finally, a complex of buildings connect the temple of the god of the underworld, Rashap, to the sanctuary of divinized ancestors (1800-1600 BCE) entombed under the living quarters of the crown prince. Matthiae concludes that the &ldquo;tradition of the divinization of dead kings and faith in the essential protection these divine beings offer the community of the living, the reigning household, and the whole of society, derive in Syria from the very beginnings of urban life&rdquo;, that is, around the second half of the third millenium BCE.</p>

        <p>The author firstly investigates the epistemological nature of an omen, defined as &laquo;a clearly defined perception understood as a sign pointing to future events whenever it manifests itself under identical circumstances&raquo;. Maul highlights the empirical nature of an omen, since the normative relationship between what is perceived and the future event is established following a period of detailed examination of the world. He also stresses, however, that starting from the second millennium BCE Mesopotamian omina ceased to be detected empirically, and a firm conceptual link was established following the application of regularities. Similarly to Buccellati&rsquo;s frequent search for an &lsquo;-emic&rsquo; vocabulary, also Maul looks for a Sumerian or Akkadian equivalent for the terms &lsquo;oracle&rsquo; or &lsquo;omen&rsquo; - coming to the conclusion that there are no such terms in the Mesopotamian vocabulary. The scholar provides a very well written and detailed synthesis of divination in Ancient Mesopotamia, providing examples of their different types, modes, as well as cultural and social background.</p>
<p>Maul highlights how in ancient Mesopotamia ominous signs were indeed interpreted as divine revelations and insights into the intentions of the gods, and yet men could also change the future revealed by the signs through prayers, sacrifices and incantations which could make the gods revise their intentions. Thus, future was conceived as the result of a dialogue between man and god: deities could speak directly to humans (through prophets, dreams, or signs in the sky, on earth, and even on people). On their side, men could take the initiative and seek for divine guidance in a variety of ways (oracles, sacrifices, rituals). Maul, therefore, comes to the conclusion that divination was &laquo;not an expression of fatalism or a listless resignation. Instead, it allowed shape to be given to an amorphous, in many situations threatening, future. This deprives the at first unfathomable future of some of its dread.&raquo; (p. 363)</p>

        <p>This volume consists in a translation of the author original book <em>Die Wahrsagekunst im Alten Orient: Zeichen des Himmels und der Erde</em> (Munich: Beck, 2013): it provides English readers with a comprehensive overview of divination in ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>At first, the author offers an introduction to the ancient Near Eastern sources that shed light on divinatory practices; then, he contextualizes divination, especially extispicy, within the context of sacrificial cult. Maul provides a thorough description of the Mesopotamian extispicy ritual, and the most relevant points for reflection are mainly two: firstly, the juridical framework of extispicy, whose language was largely borrowed from the legal sources. Secondly, Maul emphasizes the binary system of extispicy, according to which extispicy was able to provide answers about the future only insofar as diviners were able to formulate the right questions whose positive or negative answers also had to be correctly interpreted. The author provides examples of such questions, that are known from collections which represent a useful source of information on the concerns that led individuals to seek out the services of a diviner.</p>
<p>Though the main focus of the volume is on extispicy, Maul also discusses other types of divination, such as rites involving flour, incense smoke, and oil: while doing so, he emphasizes that such practices were not separate branches of divination but variants of the same discipline, which followed the same hermeneutical principles.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this volume Maul highlights the connections between divination, politics, culture and society with a particular attention on the diachronic development of the phaenomenon. He also highlights how the art of ancient divination was a system based to principles which may be considered akin to modern scientific principles of observation, measurement, collection, and testing.</p>

        <p>In the opening paragraphs of this article, the author defines pilgrimage (which is said to embrace many characteristics, such as mobility, affirmation of social identity, material and economic exchanges, punctuated and/or habitual participation, and dramatic rites) as «a socially-constituting framework with refracted practices across a long timeframe». <strong>Inter-cultural pilgrimage, instead, is «a time-space edge bringing together different socio-cultural communities.»</strong> (p. 11)
McCorriston poses the question of how to identify pilgrimage in the archaeological record, and proposes a variety of case-studies from the Neolithic period on. Ultimately, the scholar&rsquo;s goal is to prove that <strong>pilgrimage provided inter-cultural spaces to integrate peoples of different cultural backgrounds</strong>. «Inter-cultural pilgrimage was a process of appropriation and federalization of pilgrimage places that took place during the emergence of state political identity.» (p. 19) Considered as federalizing tactic, thus, pilgrimage would have provided to ancient political entities the framework for social constitution of multi-ethnic polities in which differences among different social groups would be manifested through pilgrimage practices carried out withinin shared spaces.</p>

        <p>In this article, MacMahon investigates the Mesopotamian stepped temple towers known as ziggurats, taking into consideration their visibility within and beyond the city and analysing them in the context of the Near Eastern built landscapes. Firstly, the ideology and symbolic message of such iconic buildings are highlighted: being royally commissioned buildings, they reflected the kings’ ability to access resources and control labour, while also legitimising their authority. Furthermore, in their being divine abodes, ziggurats were also places where the divine and human worlds could meet. Ziggurats were at the same time ‘communal’, because they served the civic communities where they were placed - but their access was also strictly restricted to priests, royalty, and the elite.</p>
<p>MacMahon identifies a distinction between ziggurats that were built in the southern Mesopotamian plains (where any man-made structure was potentially highly visible) and those located in the Assyrian landscape, characterised by hills, river valleys and distant mountains (here, man-made structures needed greater scale, particularly vertical, to achieve the same visibility). The author also notes that ziggurats did not stand in isolation but were instead surreounded by other buildings of various functions, that would have restricted viewing. Interestingly, McMahon tries to reproduce the ancient perception of ziggurats seen &ldquo;from below&rdquo;, even considering the interference to visibility given by dust haze and sandstorms that might have impaired the view in the past.</p>
<p>Through a careful analysis of the topography of ancient Mesopotamian cities, the scholar comes to the conclusion that «Given the surrounding buildings, terrace and courtyard walls, and winding streets, the full ziggurat would have been visible only from within its surrounding courtyard, at close range. The courtyard also may have invoked a psychological reaction. (&hellip;) This combination of huge open space and the ziggurat’s mass and height would have been visually dramatic, particularly in contrast to the crowded, narrow streets experienced on the journey through the city to the temple.» (pp. 331-332). Finally, McMahon analyzes the view &ldquo;from the ziggurat&rdquo;: this offered a panoptic view on the entire city and its surroundings, potentially up to c. 18 km distant.</p>

        <p>This paper analyzes the topic of ancient perception of time with an original and significative approach, which is profoundly hermeneutical in its taking firstly into consideration the modern sensorial consideration of time so as to &laquo;<strong>avoid potential misconceptions about interpretations of thoughts in ancient times caused by not having considered precisely the subjectivity of our own modern way of thinking</strong>&raquo; (p. 211).</p>
<p>The Mesopotamian notion of time is exemplified by extracts from the literary compositions <em>Atrahasis</em> and <em>Enuma Eliš</em>, while modern understanding is mainly investigated by using extracts from the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> by Immanuel Kant - though modern physicists such as Stephen Hawking, Steven Weinberg and Albert Einstein are also discussed. Further examples are taken from Aristotle’s and Martin Heidegger’s writings.</p>
<p>The author is perfectly aware of the difficulty to translate different languages from different linguistic branches, due to the fact that &laquo;all languages mould the manner in which a person thinks and perceives reality. The more distant two languages are, the more complicated the complete transfer of an idea between both languages can be&raquo; (p. 214). And yet, precisely thanks to such awareness he manages to carefully discuss the ancient literary passages, highlighting the similarities and differences between the ancient and modern thoughts and providing useful insights on the ancient Mesopotamian perception of time.</p>

        <p>This insightful article distinguishes sharply between <strong>Biblical monotheism</strong> (particularly in its moral structure) and <strong>Mesopotamian polytheism</strong> (which Mendenhall likens to contemporary North American society, and liberalism in general).</p>
<p>The &laquo;structures of control systems&raquo; (political or social power) and values, while opposites, are not necessarily at war with each other. &laquo;The clear message of the Bible is that social systems can continue to exist only where a minimally tolerable <strong>value system</strong> has already become operative&raquo; (p. 171). Further, &laquo;the mainstream of biblical faith is … the affirmation of a real factor in human life and experience that is independent of, not produced by, but ultimately essential to the existence and satisfactory operation of any social control system.&raquo; (p. 171)</p>
<p>The second part of the article is an outline of what could be a &laquo;monumental ten volume work&raquo; if the author had the energy to complete it. He compares &laquo;Covenant&raquo; with &laquo;Law&raquo; along 10 different axes, and demonstrates the radical difference between the two. <strong>Covenant</strong>, in brief, creates <em>ex nihilo</em> a society oriented to the good; <strong>law</strong> presupposes a society and attempts to exclude the negative by enacting a war between society and the transgressor.</p>
<p>The competition between power structures is insoluble in their own terms alone. &laquo;A sense of <strong>justice and right … must take precedence over selfish interest</strong>. The permanent symbol of the necessity as well as the reality of that Rule of God is the crucifixion of Jesus&ndash;the equally permanent affirmation that &laquo;winning&raquo; in the jungle of social manipulation and social competitiveness cannot be the controlling motivation of those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and peace.&raquo; (p. 178).</p>

        <p>In this paper, Michalowski offers a lexical analysis of the <em>Enuma Elish</em>, focusing on some specific Akkadian terms which appear in the composition. Amongst them, he also investigates the two Babylonian words for &ldquo;noise&rdquo;, namely <em>rigmu</em> and <em>huburu</em>.</p>
<p>The author considers &ldquo;noise&rdquo; as a metaphor for activity and creation and, in order to prove this metaphor, he analyzes a few literary passages - first and foremost, the stories of the Flood included in <em>Atrahasis</em> and <em>Gilgamesh</em> (see in particular pp. 387-389). Michalowski concludes that «The metaphor of noise &hellip; establishes a privileged position for the concept of creation, activity, independence. (&hellip;) [it] asserts the place of humanity in the universe, not as a blind slave of the gods, but as an independent, creative being. (&hellip;) Those who would interpret noise literally in the flood narratives, claiming that it is a mark of overpopulation, have completely missed the point, for they would see human beings as mere puppets of the gods» (p. 389).</p>

        <p>&laquo;Recent studies in oral tradition have shown that many societies produced oral and written literature simultaneously. Such a model for biblical literature proposes that a tale circulating by word of mouth only was virtually unknown, just as a tale circulating by text only was equally rare. Written texts circulated in spoken form by recitation long after they were committed to writing. And those recited forms spawned oral forms that were never in writing, or were not put in writing for some time afterwards. Ancient Near Eastern and ethnographic societies in similar situations also provide information on performance contexts for the oral component of this interplay&raquo; (author’s abstract on <a href="https://doi.org/10.4000/rsr.1467">publisher’s website</a>).</p>

        <p>&laquo;The establishment of an <strong>absolute chronology</strong> for the ancient Near East depends essentially upon identifying the <strong>recorded observations of ancient astronomers</strong>. In this paper, Wayne Mitchell undertakes a comprehensive review of these records, starting with the ancient texts themselves. He concludes that astronomical data can form the basis of an absolute Near Eastern chronology, but that there are other solutions at least as acceptable as those previously proposed. These new solutions result from a re-investigation of the observations, using a computer program capable of accommodating various theories on the long term deceleration of the Earth’s rate of rotation. The date range of the computer run was extended to take in the radically low chronology proposed in <em>JACF</em> 1. As a result, there emerges the strong possibility of revising the accession of King <strong>Ammizaduga</strong> of the 1st Dynasty of Babylon down by 163 years to 1419 BC&raquo; (author’s abstract on p. 7).</p>

        <p>Among the many <strong>rituals</strong> performed in ancient Mesopotamia, that of the <strong>enthronement of the new king</strong> (text 1 in this book) was particularly felt by ancient people, specifically during the Neo-Assyrian kingdom, when the king was perceived as the deputy on earth of the most important god of the pantheon, Assur. Besides, the author presents another text reporting instruction for the servants of the king for the preparation of the king’s meal (text 2 in this book): being the king the hypostasis of a god, also his meal has to be prepared with carefulness.  </p>

        <p>This article investigates the nature and role of the visual arts when they act as either agent or patient in the accomplishment of a ritual. As case-studies, Nadali analyzes several examples of artefacts: royal statues which underwent rituals that made them &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, statues of gods, and pictures representing human figures (kings, officials, and attendants) as well as human-shaped gods in religious contexts. </p>
<p>In considering in particular the human-shaped statues of gods, Nadali highlights how these made the invisible (i.e., the divine) visible, and thus properly comparable to the human world. &ldquo;The real value of pictures and therefore of rituals and, conversely, the real value of rituals and therefore of pictures, is the anthropomorphic codification where the gods are represented as humans and the viewer can take part in the ritual through his body, both in reality and in pictures&rdquo; (p. 224). Nadali also reminds the highly performative value of pictures representing rituals: indeed, gestures, movements and body positions which had been depicted by the ancient artists aimed to activate the same process of gestures, movements, body positions and emotion in the viewers.</p>

        <p>This article proposes that <strong>two forms of divine wrath exist</strong>: the first is a <strong>potency of the divine</strong> and is unified to his own actions; the second is a <strong>separate power</strong>, perhaps a distinct member of the divine pantheon. Within the Bible, these two forms are not entirely distinct, nor can one discern a linear progress from the first to the second, as other scholars have proposed. Rather, even in late texts that probably belong to the hellenistic period, YHWH is presented as a &ldquo;divine warrior&rdquo; whose wrath coincides with his person. Nihan also affirms that <strong>divine repentance is rare or even nonexistent</strong>. Rather than &ldquo;repenting&rdquo; (nḥm) YHWH sometimes &ldquo;renounces the evil that he had planned to do.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s anger is &ldquo;spent&rdquo;, but not repented of except in a few rare verses, such as Jer 42:10 and 1 Ch 21:15. &ldquo;This anger, frequently described as blind and excessive, is not generally the object of any repentence; despite the contrary readings which have been proposed, the pertinence of this category applied to divine wrath in the Hebrew Bible must be legitimately called into question.&rdquo;</p>

sources of ancient Near Eastern prophecy, and to open new vistas of research for specialists &ndash; cuneiformists as well as scholars in biblical and religious studies. […] The temporal and geographical distribution of the sources examined in this book ranges from Mari of the eighteenth century B.C.E., to the Hebrew Bible, to Assyria of the seventh century B.C.E., and to Arabian documents from the seventh century C.E.

        <p>Nissinen&rsquo;s treatment of ancient prophecy aims to discuss individual features of, and examine potential relationships among, three major extant textual groups of sources attesting the prophetical phenomenon in antiquity, i.e., Greek, Ancient Near Eastern, and Biblical. The book&rsquo;s first part deals with issues pertaining to the nature, constitution, and definitions of ancient prophecy. </p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts. In Part I, &ldquo;Theory&rdquo;, Nissinen outlines the main theoretical and methodological aspects of his approach. He builds on the fundamental observation that prophecy does not exist as a natural phenomenon; rather, it is constructed, socially and historically - both by the communities in which prophets functioned and by those who seek to define, reconstruct and understand it. Nissinen maintains that ancient human societies sought elaborated their symbolic universe through divination, in an attempt &laquo;to cope with contingency, uncertainty, and insecurity&raquo; (p. 19). In Part II, &ldquo;Sources&rdquo;, the author employs his methods to the available sources for ancient Near Eastern sources (pp. 57-115), Greek sources (pp. 116-43), and Hebrew Bible (pp. 144-67). Finally, in Part III, &ldquo;Comparative Essays&rdquo;, Nissinen draws together conclusions from the three corpora previously analyzed, in five thematic essays: &ldquo;Prophecy and Ecstasy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Prophets and Temples&rdquo;, &ldquo;Prophets and Kings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prophecy and Gender&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Some of Nissinen&rsquo;s conclusions are as follows. Considered as an intuitive type of divination, prophecy is sharply distinguished from technical types in Mesopotamian sources, a little less so in the Hebrew Bible, and in a &ldquo;far from absolute&rdquo; fashion in Greece (p. 334). The author highlights the affiliation of prophets with temples in all the available sources, while also showing very clearly the political function of prophecy throughout the ancient Eastern Mediterranean. He also reflects on the materiality of prophetical texts, which increasingly became the object of focus &laquo;as a sign and a carrier of revelation&raquo; which led the scribes to relegate oral prophetic performances to a marginal position (p. 352).</p>
<p>Overall, this dense and articulated book draws from a massive amount of primary data and provide extensive and recent bibliography in the field of comparative studies on ancient prophecy.</p>

        <p>&laquo;<strong>Prophecy</strong> was a wide-spread phenomenon in the ancient world – not only in ancient Israel but in the whole Eastern Mediterranean cultural sphere. This is demonstrated by documents from the ancient Near East […]. The present volume presents a selection of thirty-one essays, bringing together essential aspects of prophetic <strong>divination in the ancient Near East</strong>. The first section of the volume discusses prophecy from theoretical perspectives. The second sections contains studies on prophecy in texts from Mari and Assyria and other cuneiform sources. The third section discusses biblical prophecy in its ancient Near Eastern context, while the fourth section focuses on prophets and prophecy in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Even prophecy in the Dead Sea Scrolls is discussed in the fifth section. The articles are essential reading for anyone studying ancient prophetic phenomenon&raquo; (from overview on <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/518182?tab_body=overview">publisher’s website</a>).</p>

        <p>Noegel aims to investigate the topic of dreams and their interpretations through the Mesopotamian evidence and the Hebrew Bible. He mostly adopts Oppenheim&rsquo;s classification of dreams between &ldquo;message&rdquo; dreams, in which a god or important figure appears and delivers a missive to the dreamer, and &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo; dreams, in which the dreamer witnesses enigmatic visual images that require an interpretation. He implements Oppenheim&rsquo;s basic typologies by making a clear distinction between literary and historical texts, and taking into consideration the overlaps existing within such quite simple and schematic classification.</p>
<p>Noegel begins by surveying the abudant Mesopotamian evidence, available in a variety of textual genres including ritual, oracular, epistolary, historical, dedicatory, and literary texts. Particular attention is given to the collection of dream oracles known as the <em>Babylonian Dream Book</em>, to its content as well as literary and stylistic features; also ritual texts complementing that compendium of symbolic dreams (the so-called <em>namburb&#251;</em>) are described in details.</p>
<p>Particularly relevant to Buccellati&rsquo;s volume is the comparison made by Noegel between Mesopotamian and Biblical views on dreams, which appears in the second part of this article.</p>
<p>Noegel highlights differences between the two cultural words: in Mesopotamia, dreams were associated with gods or demons - the Israelite&rsquo;s belief system, instead, left little room for any agent (mechanical or divine) other than Yahweh, also in the dreaming and interpretive process. Also the role and characterization of the interpreter was radically different: the Bible, indeed, forbids &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; religio-mantic acts (Deut. 13:2-6, 18:9-15) and consistently portrays foreigners as not having the divine wisdom, like Israelites, to decipher enigmatic dreams.</p>
<p>However, Noegel also finds some similarities in these two cultural words: firstly, they both say dreams as divine in origin. Then, in both cultures the deity was perceived as a judge; there was a strong belief in the performative power of words;and the <em>lex talionis</em> constituted a legal, theological, and literary principle.</p>
<p>Noegel thus believes that, despite their cultural and theological differences, Mesopotamian texts and the Bible share a great deal in common with respect to dreams and their interpretations - both in details and in conceptual framework. He also maintains that the Mesopotamian parallels helps to appreciate better Israelite references to dreams in the Bible&rsquo;s prophetic corpus. These texts mirror the development in Israelite attitudes toward dreams and prophecy as a cultural institution, following the growing Assyrian political, military, and cultural predominance in the Near East from the eight century BCE onward.</p>

        <p>The <strong>interpretation of dreams</strong> in ancient Mesopotamia is attested by many texts (see e.g. <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Noegel2001DreamsandDream">Noegel 2001 Dreamsand Dream</a> and <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Oppenheim1956Dreams">Oppenheim 1956 Dreams</a>; cf. also <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%2011_mDP.htm"><em>Appendix 11</em></a>). The author analyses in this contribution a specific feature of dream Mesopotamian texts, i.e. the use of an <strong>allusive language</strong> making the interpretation of dreams even more difficult.</p>
<p>[The ‘mysteries’ to be cracked in the analysis of Mesopotamian dreams are veiled by the darkness of some allusive expressions, sometimes very difficult to be translated and interpreted (also because of linguistic limits in the understanding of some Akkadian expressions); it results that also in antiquity, dreams could have been interpreted in different ways according to the different understandings of these allusive expressions.]</p>

        <p>How did human societies scale up from tight-knit groups of hunter-gatherers to the large, anonymous, cooperative societies of today, even though anonymity is the enemy of cooperation? How did organized religions with &ldquo;Big Gods&rdquo;, the great monotheistic and polytheistic faiths, spread to colonize most minds in the world? In Big Gods, Ara Norenzayan makes the surprising argument that these fundamental puzzles about the origins of civilization answer each other. – Sincere faith in watchful Big Gods unleashed unprecedented cooperation within ever-expanding groups, yet at the same time it introduced a new source of potential conflict between competing groups. And in some parts of the world, societies with atheist majorities, some of the most cooperative and prosperous in the world, have climbed religion&rsquo;s ladder, and then kicked it away. – Big Gods answers fundamental questions about the origins and spread of world religions and helps us understand the rise of cooperative societies without belief in gods. – [Publisher&rsquo;s summary]</p>

        <p><em>Chapter 4</em> of the volume <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Puech1976Storia">Puech 1976 Storia</a> (by Jean Nougayrol) presents the fundamental concepts of <strong>Babylonian religion</strong>, dealing with the actual perception of religion in historical times, the pantheon, clergy, cults and ceremonies, mythology, prayer, and magic.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the author underlines how it is impossible to analyse Babylonian religious thought without taking into account its origin from Sumerian religion. The author focuses on delineating the basic <strong>similarities</strong> and mostly the evident <strong>differences</strong> between the two religious systems, stressing how Babylonian religion benefited of a specific (both linguistic and theoretic) Semitic apport.</p>
<p>The author describes the Babylonian <strong>pantheon</strong> as a ‘static system’: despite the fact that the list of divine names evolved during times (from the Old to the Neo-Babylonian period), the basic organisation of the pantheon remains almost the same. Furthermore, the author points out the system of <strong><em>interpretatio Babyloniaca</em></strong> of Sumerian deities, a well-known process of ‘translation’ of the Sumerian gods’ names into Akkadian), involving sometimes not only a mere linguistic translation of the name but also a different conception of the same deity (changing previous features or adding new attributes).</p>
<p>Religious beliefs are expressed in <strong>myths</strong>: the author stresses how Babylonian took Sumerian myths and ‘completed’ some of them, adding new elements previously absent: e.g., the basic account of the creation was taken by the Babylonians from previous Sumerian version (such as the <a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.7.4#"><em>Eridu Genesis</em></a>, the <a href="https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&amp;ObjectID=P222183"><em>Barton Cylinder</em></a>, the <em>Debate between Sheep and Grain</em>, <a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3.2&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc#">transliteration</a>-<a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.2#">translation</a>, and the <em>Debate between Winter and Summer</em>, <a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3.3&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc#">transliteration</a>-<a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.3#">translation</a>), later ‘completed’ with the composition of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/article/225/enuma-elish---the-babylonian-epic-of-creation---fu/"><em>Enûma Eliš</em></a> and the <em>Atramhasis</em> (for a general introduction to this text and an English translation, see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Foster2005Before">Foster 2005 Before</a>, pp. 227-280).   </p>
<p>A concretization of religious beliefs of the Babylonians is testified by <strong>prayers</strong> and <strong>exorcisms</strong>: anyhow, the author underlines how also in this field we cannot have a direct access to personal prayer, since what we do have is represented by composition written by scribes, according to a precise tradition (thus, we deal with a ‘social belief’).</p>
<p><strong>Mantic</strong> is specific of Babylonian culture: the author stresses how in this sphere the contact with previous Sumerian tradition is almost lacking. The many different mantic techniques of the Babylonians are then carefully displayed. </p>
<p>Other actualizations of religious beliefs can be found in <strong>magic</strong> and <strong>ceremonies</strong>, stressing again how in Babylon ‘religion’ and ‘magic’ were two spheres strictly connected each other. </p>
<p>The author points out a noteworthy concept: speaking about Babylonian religion, we have to admit that we are actually dealing with Babylonian religion<strong>s</strong>, since the documentation on this topic is very multifaceted, and we do not have a systematic original expression of Babylonian ‘theoretical religion’.</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter, the author retraces the influences of Babylonian religion on coeval or later religious beliefs and the survival of Babylonian religious elements in other cultures (e.g. Hittites, Israel, Greece, and Rome), reaching also modern times through influences on the Old Testament.  </p>
<p>[This chapter delineates the Babylonian religious belief and its concrete manifestations in cultic activities. The remark expressed in § 9 (where the author recognises influences and survivals of Babylonian religion), can support G. Buccellati’s idea expressed in <em>Chapter 2</em>, <em>Section 3</em>: &laquo;A second reason why the Mesopotamian religion is of deep interest to us today is its <strong>continuity</strong> with our cultural and religious traditions. On the one hand, certain fossils have survived in their specific reality, such as, astrology. But the <strong>influence</strong> on the very structure of our way of thinking is far more significant than these specific details, because it affects the social and intellectual sphere as a whole&raquo;.]</p>

        <p>This paper deals with the basic concepts of <strong>religion</strong> and <strong>ritual</strong>, underlining the reciprocal relation between the two entities. Religion is here specifically defined as &laquo;a major <strong>‘prime mover’</strong> in the rise of civilized societies&raquo; (p. 117). </p>
<p>The author also underlines the intrinsic limits in knowledge for any prehistoric archaeologist, mostly because of the absence of writing.</p>
<p>Another topic involves the development of specialized ‘religious’ or ‘mortuary’ structures, sometimes entangled in the domestic context (as e.g. the benched-inhumation at <a href="http://www.catalhoyuk.com/">Çatalhöyük</a>, in Turkey; cf. <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hodder2010Emergence">Hodder 2010 Emergence</a>). </p>
<p>The development of the social concept of religion and its practical actualizations in terms of rituality is then investigated, starting from Sumerian, Babylonian, and Anatolian contexts (with insights on the Iranian area). </p>
<p>The focus then moves to <strong>burial practices</strong>, offering many examples from Mesopotamia and Syria. According to the author, the two concepts of ‘religion’ and ‘mortuary rituals’ are strictly connected (p. 118).</p>
<p>The author then analyses the difference between children’s and adult’s graves, underlining how sometimes children’s burial were denotated by a different assemblage, similarly as at <a href="http://urkesh.org/">Urkesh/Tell Mozan</a> (see <a href="http://urkesh.org/abstracts/923Kharobietal2014a.htm">Kharobi <em>et al.</em> 2014a</a> and <a href="http://urkesh.org/abstracts/923Kharobietal2014b.htm">Kharobi <em>et al.</em> 2014b</a>). </p>
<p>It follows a description of the ritual of <em>breaking objects</em> on occasion of burial rituals, together with the deposition of <strong>clay figurines</strong> (sometimes also depicted on potsherds), specifically the so-called <strong>‘Mother Goddesses’</strong> or <strong>‘fertility figures’</strong>, interpreted on the base of <strong>ethnographical parallels</strong> from modern African, American (Navaho), and Christian cultures. </p>
<p>Briefly summarizing: &laquo;We must conclude that despite some very interesting, at times even spectacular, evidence for what are certainly ritual practices, we know nothing about ‘religion’ behind them&raquo; (p. 122).      </p>
<p>[The paper is particularly noteworthy for its attempt to define the concepts of ‘religion’, ‘magic’, and ‘rituals’ in ancient Mesopotamia, focusing on archaeological data and ethnographical parallels. The contribution helps in building a comparative approach in interpreting religious phaenomena on the base of actual archaeological evidence.]</p>

<p>The author then investigates the development of the social concept of religion and its practical actualizations in terms of rituality, starting from the Sumerian, Babylonian, and Anatolian contexts (with some insights on the Iranian area).</p>
<p>Later on, the focus moves to <strong>burial practices</strong>: &ldquo;If religion is defined as belief in spiritual or supernatural &lsquo;beings&rsquo; or &lsquo;agencies&rsquo;, then burial practices may provide the archaeologist with his best clues&rdquo; (p. 118). The paragraph then offers many examples of such burial practices as they were performed in Mesopotamia and Syria.</p>
<p>The following paragraph is devoted to the analysis of the role played, within burials, by the deposition of <strong>clay figurines</strong>, even crafted in alabaster, both human and animal, found in Mesopotamian graves during the 6th millennium BC; the importance of these finds is stressed as such: &ldquo;Such objects constitute the category of evidence most widely cited in support of prehistoric religion, but their remarkable diversity undoubtedly precludes any single explanation of their purpose&rdquo; (p. 120). The author also shows how sometimes these figures are even depicted on potsherds, as the exemplar from Choga Mami displayed on pl. 4a. A description of the so-called &lsquo;Mother Goddesses&rsquo; or &lsquo;fertility figures&rsquo; is then developed, also recurring to <strong>ethnographical parallels</strong> from modern Africa and Christian culture to explain the actual role of these figurines. </p>
<p>Here are the basic conclusions: &ldquo;We must conclude that despite some very interesting, at times even spectacular, evidence for what are certainly ritual practices, we know nothing about &lsquo;religion&rsquo; behind them&rdquo; (p. 122).</p>

<p>The title given by the author to the chapter (taken from Hölderlin) is indicative of the particular perspective adopted in investigating such a topic: &laquo;Nah ist &ndash; und schwer zu fassen der Gott&raquo;; this particular feature leads the author to approach the thematic of Mesopotamian religion also under a <strong>psychological perspective</strong> (see specifically pp. 198ff.).</p>
<p>The first paragraph presents another tricky sentence: &laquo;Why a ‘Mesopotamian religion’ should not be written&raquo;. The author explains this statement advancing the problems of the &laquo;nature of the available evidence&raquo; and that of &laquo;comprehension across the barriers of <strong>conceptual conditioning</strong>&raquo; (p. 172). The author describes how the archaeological evidence is still not well understood in its actual function, and the textual attestations are difficult to be interpreted as briefly expressed on p. 175: &laquo;In short, how truthfully do they [i.e. written sources] reveal what is commonly meant by religion?&raquo;; this last assertion is strictly connected to the general problem of interpreting the past, an interpretation affected by the trouble of the existence of a <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm"><strong>broken tradition</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the author continues in describing the nature and contents of Mesopotamian texts related to religion, focusing on the metaphysical nature of Mesopotamian deities, on the role of the king as interpreter of the divine will, and on the role of some specific and peculiar religious texts involving <strong>exorcisms</strong> or <strong><em>omina</em></strong>, presented in a continuum crossing several millennia.</p>
<p>The following paragraph (pp. 183ff.) focuses on the care and feeding of the gods, i.e. on the ritual daily practices performed in temples to acquaintance the gods and to obtain their benevolence, describing the organization of ritual aspects in Mesopotamian society (offering parallels with Egyptian culture and with the Old Testament).</p>
<p>An interesting paragraph (pp. 198ff.) deals with <strong>Mesopotamian ‘psychology’</strong>, involving the relationship between individuals and deities: in this respect, &laquo;the deity is sometimes felt to be the leader, patron, or protector of groups, be these families or professional and religious associations&raquo; (p. 198). The discussion continues with a description of <strong>Mesopotamian mythology</strong> and with the inclusion, in the personal and psychological experience, of the existence of four protective <strong>‘spirits’</strong> which &laquo;are individualized and mythologized carriers of certain specific psychological aspects of one basic phaenomenon, the realization of the <strong>self</strong>, the personality, as it relates the ego to the outside world and, at the same time, separates one from the other&raquo; (pp. 198-199).</p>
<p>The last paragraph (pp. 206ff.) is devoted to the presentation of the arts of the <strong>diviner</strong>, emphasizing the importance of <strong>divination</strong> in Mesopotamian culture and mind: &laquo;Basically, divination represents a technique of communication with the supernatural forces that are supposed to shape the history of the individuals as well as that of the group&raquo; (p. 207). The paragraph goes on describing the different actual divination practices attested in Mesopotamian texts, such as the <strong>throwing of lots</strong>, the <strong>lecanomancy</strong>, and the <strong>libanomancy</strong> (pp. 207f.), all described as both operational and <strong>magical techniques</strong> owned and performed by special priests.   </p>
<p>[The volume discusses many aspects of ancient Mesopotamian religion. The most interesting portion of the chapter is indeed at the very beginning, where the author addresses a challenging statement, “Why a ‘Mesopotamian religion’ should not be written”: the author discusses the very definition of the word ‘religion’ in ancient Mesopotamian culture, explaining how the whole complex of religious beliefs can be grasped only through the analysis of its actual realisations, i.e. the Mesopotamian cultic practices, within a psychological perspective.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;This book analyzes the history of Mesopotamian imagery from the mid-second to mid-first millennium BCE. It demonstrates that in spite of rich textual evidence, which grants the Mesopotamian gods and goddesses an anthropomorphic form, there was a clear abstention in various media from visualizing the gods in such a form. True, divine human-shaped cultic images existed in Mesopotamian temples. But as a rule, non-anthropomorphic visual agents such as inanimate objects, animals or fantastic hybrids replaced these figures when they were portrayed outside of their sacred enclosures. […] The plausible consolidation of the relevant Biblical accounts just before the Babylonian Exile or, more probably within the Exile […] points to a direct correspondence between comparable religious phenomena. It is suggested that far from their homeland and in the absence of a temple for their god, the Judahite deportees adopted and intensified the Mesopotamian avoidance of anthropomorphic pictorial portrayals of deities&raquo; (from author’s abstract online).</p>
<p>[This book represents an attempt of retrieving the historical origins of the biblical image ban in the representation of God.]</p>

        <p>This volume has the ambition to present a vision of reality, a cosmovision, different from the current cosmology in the dominant culture. The trinitarian vision of reality is not limited to the conception that is called Christian: it is much more ample and universal. Humanity has always had a more or less clear consciousness of a superior Mystery, transcendent or immanent to Man. [&hellip; The cosmotheandric] vision tells us that reality is not formed by a single indistinct block - be it divine, spiritual, or material -, nor by three blocks or a world on three levels / the world of the Gods (or of Transcendence), the world of men (or of Consciousness) and the physical world (or of Matter) /, as if it were a building with three floors. Reality is constituted by three dimensions related to each other - the trinitarian perichoresis -, in such a way that not only does one not exist without the other, but all three are interwoven inter-in-dependently.

        <p>Parpola proposes an interpretation of the meaning of the <strong>Mesopotamian Tree motif</strong> found throughout the Near East, which appears in many variants but essentially &laquo;consists of a trunk with a palmette crown standing on the stone base and surrounded by a network of horizontal or intersecting lines fringed with palmettes, pinecones, or pomegranates.&raquo; (p. 164). The lack of textual evidence renders interpretation difficult. Parpola builds on existing interpretations which indicate that the tree represents both the divine world order, and the king as the realization of that order in man, a perfect man.</p>
<p>Parpola&rsquo;s contribution rests on the hypothesis that the <strong>Sefirotic Tree of Life</strong> derives directly from the Mesopotamian Tree. It contains the dual symbolism already mentioned, in that it refers to the order of creation, and also to man as a microcosm created in the image of God. This hypothesis can be tested, in Parpola&rsquo;s opinion, by replacing the elements of the Sefirotic Tree with corresponding gods and mystic numbers from the Mesopotamian pantheon. The result (summarized in the diagram on pp. 179 and 183) is coherent and provides further paths for discovery: Assur is missing from the diagram, but can be identified with the winged disk over the Assyrian Tree. Furthermore, the tree is composed of &ldquo;three successive generations of gods appearing horizontally as interrelated trinities&rdquo; (p. 187). Still more, the distribution of the mystic numbers derived from the Mesopotamian gods correspond to the positive, negative, and equilibrium features of the three pillars of the Sefirotic tree. Parpola shows this with a neat arithmetic argument, which in his view &laquo;amounts to mathematical proof of the correctness of the reconstruction.&raquo; (p. 189)</p>
<p>In the third part of his article, <strong>Parpola extends the logic of the tree to three concrete examples to show how it enriches the understanding of Mesopotamian religion</strong>. First, he notes that the incipit of <em>Enuma elis</em> can be better understood through a mathematical rephrasing: &laquo;When the primordial state of undifferentiated unity (Apsu + Mummu + Tiamat, &laquo;0&raquo;), in which nothing existed, came to an end, nothingness was replaced by the binary system of oppositions (Lahmu and Lahamu) and the infinite universe (Ansar = Assur) with its negative counterpart (Kisar). Assur emanated Heaven (Anu) as his primary manifestation, to mirror his existence to the world. Thus rephrased, the passage
comes very close to Kabbalistic and Neoplatonic metaphysics.&raquo; (p. 191). Second, the Epic of Gilgamesh can likewise be better understood by realizing that it is structured after the Tree, which gives tablet XII a mystical interpretation as summarized on p. 196. Finally, the Etana myth can be re-interpreted through the tree motif and understood as &laquo;presenting Etana as the first man to achieve the ascent [to heaven], it forcefully contributes to the notion of the Mesopotamian king as the &ldquo;perfect Man&rdquo;&raquo; (p. 197).
Parpola concludes that &laquo;against all appearances, Mesopotamian religion and philosophy are not dead but still very much alive in Jewish, Christian, and Oriental mysticism and philosophies. The Tree diagram provides the key which makes it possible to bridge these different traditions and to start re- covering the forgotten <em>summa sapientia</em> of our cultural ancestors.&raquo; (p. 199).</p>
<p>The article also contains a catalog of tree and winged disc symbols, and three interesting excurses.</p>

        <p>This volume is conceived as a useful handbook to the introduction of history and culture of ancient Sumerians. It is divided into 11 chapters (this entry will be focused mainly on the chapters related to religious aspects, i.e. nos. 10-11).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 10</em> involves the Sumerian <strong>divine world</strong>: the author underlines at the beginning how &laquo;Sumerian civilization becomes incomprehensible if the profound religiosity of this people is not put in the right light, even if we do not always manage to perceive the peculiarities of a world so far away in time&raquo; (p. 306). It means, in few words, that Sumerian culture is strongly embedded in religion. The author further stresses how the Sumerian divinities are strictly connected to a specific city, sometimes acting as <strong>polyad gods/goddesses</strong> (p. 306). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the scholar highlights a fundamental limit to our knowledge: &laquo;Indeed, scholars are fully aware of the difficulty of drawing a picture, albeit summary, of the Sumerian religious beliefs: the lack of knowledge of the material, especially epigraphic, and the tendency of literary compositions, often due to needs of a syncretistic nature, constitute serious concerns an investigation of the Sumerian religion. To these external difficulties, so to speak, there is another of an intrinsic nature: the Sumerians have not handed down theological treatises to us; we must derive their thought and their religious conceptions from the mythological texts, which however are often inscrutable for us&raquo; (p. 306). Pettinato also stresses how the reconstruction of Sumerian religion in prehistoric and proto-historic times is built mainly on archaeological evidence, while from the late fourth millennium BC, textual sources can help in this effort (p. 308).      </p>
<p><em>Chapter 11</em> recounts the <strong>intellectual world</strong> of Sumer, dealing with scribal tradition, libraries, and the different literary ‘genres’. About <strong>religion</strong>, mythological texts, divine journeys, hymns to divinities and sovereigns, and hymns to temples are examined.</p>
<p>[Specifically, on religion, Pettinato underlines the many difficulties in interpreting Sumerian religious thought and the wide limits in our understanding of their <strong>‘theology’</strong>, since no actual ‘theological’ sources have ever been written by Sumerians, and we can only grasp some clues from archaeology or other religious compositions, such as hymns, lists of gods, epics and mythology, emphasizing the following: &laquo;When we speak of ‘epic’, ‘myths’, ‘prayers’, we must be aware, under penalty of misunderstandings about the supporting structures of ancient thought, that we are using terms of convenience which in themselves reveal very little the concept or concepts that underlie the ancients texts (and what little these labels reveal&hellip; it would be better if they didn’t reveal it, so much confusion they generate!)&raquo; (p. 373)]</p>

        <p>&laquo;Not all topics can be treated in the same way. Some are too intimate or thorny to be discussed without precautions in our use of language. One of these topics is undoubtedly <strong>death</strong>, a timeless and placeless <strong>taboo</strong> in which psychological, religious, and social interdictions are embodied. The aim of this paper is to explore the linguistic devices that Akkadian speakers used to tone down the taboo and cope with death. To address the issue, written sources, belonging to different genres and time periods, are examined&raquo; (Author’s abstract on p. 137).</p>
<p>After the <em>introduction</em>, devoted to the definition of the topic, i.e. ‘death’, described as &laquo;mankind’s unavoidable destiny&raquo; (p. 1), the author moves (<em>paragraph 1</em>) to the topic of the <strong>afterlife</strong> as conceived in Mesopotamia, through the analysis (conducted also under an anthropological perspective) of the terminology used to speak about death, a realm where some words are treated as <strong>taboos</strong> (defined also as <strong>euphemisms</strong>), in a process of &laquo;<strong>linguistic interdiction</strong>&raquo; (p. 2). </p>
<p>Despite the lack of a complete publication of all Akkadian sources, the author tries &laquo;to begin bridging this gap by reflecting on the applicability of the concept of the ‘taboo’ to discourse within the Akkadian world&raquo; (p. 2). This analysis starts in <em>paragraph 2</em> from a ‘problem of imagery’, trying to retrace some specific words in Akkadian sources attested as qualifier or specifications of the concept of death, describing an imagery-lexicon: &laquo;hand of death&raquo; (<em>qāti mūtim</em>) and &laquo;mouth of death&raquo; (<em>pī mūti</em>) (p. 3). Of course, a problem of interpretation occurs, since we are dealing with a ‘broken tradition’ (see G. Buccellati’s contribution in <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm">CAR</a>. <em>Paragraph 3</em> describes the so-called ‘Scurlock Hypothesis’, focusing on some locutions used in Akkadian to express the concept of ‘being dead’.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 4</em> analyses the actual Akkadian words for ‘death’ (<em>mūtu</em>) and for the verb ‘to die’ (<em>mâtu</em>) (p. 3), stressing how these terms are applied to a specific figurative realm, involving the concepts of &laquo;‘otherworldly’ trip&raquo; or more abstract expressions, such as &laquo;to be invited by gods&raquo; (<em>qerûm</em>) or &laquo;to sleep&raquo; (p. 3; cf. p. 7); these concepts involve a trip described through a particular vocabulary including the Akkadian words for ‘road’ (<em>harrānum</em>, <em>urhum</em>) (p. 4), for ‘mountain’ (<em>šadû</em>) (p. 7), and for ‘destiny’ (<em>šīmtu</em>), in the expression &laquo;to go to one’s destiny&raquo; (p. 8). The concept of ‘sleeping’ applied to death is investigated in <em>sub-paragraph 4.2.3</em>, with reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh"><strong><em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em></strong></a> (p. 9). Indeed, the two topics of ‘fame’ and ‘death’ are well-developed and investigated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh"><strong><em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em></strong></a>, where the hero is perceived as a ‘Suchende’ (according to a definition by Hermann Hesse) of the fame (through his deeds), firstly, and of the immortality (through the quest for the plant of the endless-life) (cf. <a href="http://urkesh.org/abstracts/923MoraGiorgieri2016.htm">Mora, Giorgieri 2016</a>, directly quoting <a href="http://urkesh.org/attach/BuccellatiG1972a.pdf">Buccellati, G. 1972</a>, p. 34). </p>
<p><em>Paragraphs 5-8</em> (pp. 9-14) deeply analyse the concept of death contrasting the aforementioned ‘Scurlock Hypothesis’, while <em>paragraphs 9-10</em> deal with suicide and taboo, respectively (p. 15).</p>
<p>The author concludes: &laquo;In light of the entire discussion, it is clear that death exerted a powerful influence on the imagination of Akkadian users, which in turn deeply influenced their linguistic behaviour&raquo; (p. 16).</p>
<p>[The precise definition of specific concepts related to Mesopotamian religious thought is sometimes difficult to be established, because of the lack or at least the obscurity of determined terms clearly translatable and fully understandable by a modern reader avoiding any modern superimposition. The value of this contribution consists in the strictly philological analysis of terms or phrasal expressions used to define ‘death’ and other concepts related to that, like ‘mortality’, ‘fate’/’destiny’, ‘afterlife’, and ‘taboo’.]</p>

        <p>This speech of Pope <a href="http://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en/holy-father/pio-xii.html">Pius XII</a>, addressed to the <a href="http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en.html">Pontifical Academy of Sciences</a> in 1951, deals with the fundamental topic of the relationship between <strong>faith</strong> and <strong>reason/science</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Pope’s thought, it is clear how reason and science are not considered as enemies of faith (nor quasi “<em>ancillae theologiae</em>”), but on the contrary as a useful way to better know the order of the <em>cosmos</em>, recognising in it the action of the creator God: &laquo;In fact, true science, contrary to rash assertions of the past, the more it advances, the more it discovers God, as if He were watching and waiting behind every door that science opens&raquo; (Introduction of the speech; English translation by mDP). </p>

        <p>The volume aims to analyse the topography of the city in first-millennium BCE Mesopotamia of the first millennium, in the light - and in function of - the main rituals of the time, which were carried out also due to their being often representations of mythological events. The author examines with particular accuracy the documentation related to the akitu festival, not only because it is the most documented event, but also because it is the richest in mythical content. The author&rsquo;s examination is constantly conducted with reference to both the Babylonian and Assyrian cultures: differentiations linked to the specific political-religious background of the two geographical areas are duly highlighted.</p>
<p>The scholar begins by outlining the city space in Mesopotamia, on an ideal and symbolic level, with reference to cosmogonic myths (in particular, the Enuma Elish): the city is clearly represented as a place of order, as opposed to the steppe which is instead the place of chaos. Within the city, each symbolic place is also clearly defined. The scholar then examines the sequence and significance of the various processional stations that took place during the akitu festival.</p>
<p>Overall, Pongratz-Leisten interprets the akitu as a symbolic re-enactment of the moment preceding the establishment of Marduk&rsquo;s royalty. To support and confirm this interpretation, she proposes a specific analysis of the mythical contents of Enuma Elish, a poem in which one finds two different mythologies intertwined and merged in the same context: the struggle for divine succession and the creation of the cosmos.</p>
<p>As far as the role of the sovereign within the New Year&rsquo;s Festival is concerned, the scholar, based on the available sources, observes how in Babylon the king mostly remains in the background, while priests played the predominant role of ritual actions. In Assyria, instead, the ruler represents the central figure who attracts the greatest prestige precisely on the ritual level.</p>
<p>The volume is enriched by a vast collection of epigraphic material, which gathers many sources of different genres, and by a rich topographical documentation which helps the reader following the discussion throughout the book.</p>

        <p>In the opening pages of this article, the author presents the forms which characterised, in ancient Mesopotamia, the phaenomenon of &ldquo;sacred marriage&rdquo; (that is considered to be «one of the key metaphors used to express the close communication between the gods and the king» in the ancient Near East, p. 44). Such forms could be: cosmogamy (the union between two cosmic elements, namely Heaven and Earth); hierogamy (union between a goddess and the king); theogamy (union between two deities). Pongratz Leisten examines all these possibilities, providing several relevant Sumerian and Akkadian texts as examples.</p>
<p>Pages 47-52 are particularly interesting, as they provide a detailed overview on how the issue of the <em>hieros gamos</em> has been discussed in Assyriological scholarship - with a particularly rich bibliographic apparatus. Then, Pongratz-Leisten analyzes the phaenomenon of hierogamy and theogamy in relation with social dynamics (with a particular reference to kingship) and in light of Sumerian literature. The various forms in which hierogamies were enacted in various Near Eastern cultures (Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian) are duly considered and discussed. Ultimately, the scholar states that one of the goal of the Mesopotamian ritual was to emphasize the interconnection between the marriage rite and the king&rsquo;s active role in the provision of abundance. Thus, hierogamy and theogamy came to be dynamic forces in promoting the institution of kingship as a whole, as well as individual rulers.</p>

        <p>Pongratz-Leisten&rsquo;s ambitious goal in this article is to investigate the construct of divine agency as it was conceived in Mesopotamia, with the purpose of explaining the role of anthropomorphism in that polytheistic conception of the divine. In order to achieve this goal, the scholar starts by discussing the notion of &lsquo;person&rsquo; in ancient Mesopotamia, then defines the nature of the divine in Mesopotamia. In the second part of the article, she provides a description of the nature of divine agency and examines the astralization and solarization of gods.</p>
<p>By asking &lsquo;what is divine&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;what is meant by a god&rsquo; in ancient Mesopotamia, Pongratz-Leisten extends the notion of the divine beyond an anthropomorphic agent, while considering the possibility that agency could be extended to anything that possesses divine quality. In her opinion, the cosmos in the ancient near East was not considered as inherently divine nor unified. Gods were more than personifications of forces or parts of nature: they had the power to control and intervene over their respective realms, acting with intention and of their own will. The scholar applies the methodology and theories offered by cognitive science to ancient Near Eastern religion, thus finding an explanation for the identification of an agency even within inanimate and invisible beings. She distinguishes between the deity - being the primary agent - and his/her indices of presence (statues, symbols, or a celestial body) - i.e., the secondary agents.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphism, in this perspective, &laquo;mediates between the divinity as primary agent and his or her secondary agents.&raquo; (p. 147) Pongratz-Leisten also offers her own definition of religion, as &laquo;a system of thought and action for interpreting and influencing the world, built on anthropomorphic and animistic premises.&raquo; (p. 147)</p>
<p>In the second part of the article, the author describes why, in her opinion, astralization and solarization must be viewed as two distinct cultural strategies within the civilizations of the ancient Near East. On one side, solarization of human and divine kingship was generated by the political demand of territorial expansion, which asked for a new image of rulership claiming universal control. The astralization of the gods, instead, must be interpreted as a theological attempt to express divine supreme control over the universe - a need which occurred against the backdrop of the rise of astronomy as a science and ought to be considered a product of the professional elites with whom it was linked.</p>

        <p>This volume collects nine articles based on papers given at a Princeton conference 2007, that had the same title as the book. The concept of &ldquo;<strong>revolutionary monotheism</strong>&rdquo; was developed by Jan Assmann (see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Assmann1998Moses">Assmann 1998 Moses</a>), and in this book it is understood in two ways: «first, it has been proposed that the politics of the Sargonid kings of Assyria elicited &ldquo;an Iraelite response that directly impacted the God-idea&rdquo; that would have been &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; in the sense of being reactionary in relation to another political entity; second, it was considered &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; in terms of a radical shift in belief systems, fueled by what Assmann calls &ldquo;the Mosaic distinction.&rdquo;» (p. 11).
The book is introduced by a thorough paper by the editor, &ldquo;A New Agenda for the Study of the Rise of Monotheism&rdquo;, that presents the conditions for <strong>an up-to-date discussion of the concepts of polytheism and monotheism in the ancient Near East</strong> - thus considering Israel, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Iran.
Egypt is discussed in J. Baines&rsquo;s paper, &ldquo;Presenting and Discussing Deities in New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period Egypt&rdquo;, in which he stresses the continuity in polytheism in the history of Egypt. Akhenaten&rsquo;s short-lived revolution is proposed as an expression of monolatry rather than monotheism (p. 65). G. Rubio&rsquo;s chapter, &ldquo;Gods and Scholars: Mapping the Pantheon in Early Mesopotamia&rdquo;, emphasizes that there was indeed no &lsquo;single pantheon&rsquo; in the third millennium BC Mesopotamia - but rather a number of constellations, varying according to city, cult, scribal tradition, etc. 
The following papers by F. Rochberg (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Rochberg2011HeavensGods">Rochberg 2011 Heavens Gods</a>) and B. Pongratz-Leisten (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Pongratz-Leisten2011DivineAgency">Pongratz-Leisten 2011 Divine Agency</a>) have been extensively presented in specific bibliographic entries, thus they will not be discussed again here. The next articles shift the focus on the Hebrew Bible, to begin with P. Machinist&rsquo;s &ldquo;How Gods Die, Biblically and Otherwise: A Problem of Cosmic Restructuring&rdquo; and M.S. Smith&rsquo;s, &ldquo;God in Translation: Cross-Cultural Recognition of Divinity in Ancient Israel&rdquo; both discuss the process in Ancient Israel that led to what they both consider as true monotheism in the Hebrew Bible. According to K. Schmid, &ldquo;The Quest for &lsquo;God&rsquo;: Monotheistic Arguments in the Priestly Texts of the Hebrew Bible&rdquo;, the Priestly Code in the Pentateuch testifies to a conception of Yahweh as the only deity.
J.J. Collins, &ldquo;King and Messiah as Son of God&rdquo;, assumes that Jesus is best understood as a purely Jewish character, free from Hellenistic traits. The final contribution to this volume, from P. Oktor Skjærvø, entitled &ldquo;Zarathustra: A Revolutionary Monotheist?&rdquo;, provides an overview of the Zoroastrian literature and it comes to the conclusion that whatever theological assumptions there may be in these texts these would not be monotheistic, but rather poly- and/or henotheistic.
Considered as a whole, the volume achieves several goals: amongst these, it proves that Assmann&rsquo;s hypothesis about revolutionary monotheism is ultimately not viable (Baines, Smith, Schmid) and it provides evidence that <strong>change was a regular feature even in the more conservative religions</strong>.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this volume is to trace <strong>the development of Assyrian ideological discourse</strong> from the third millennium BC to the seventh century BC, by analysing texts, ritual practices, and images. In Chapter 1, Pongratz-Leisten describes the methodological issues, the history of research, and declares that her main goal is to explore &ldquo;dynamics between religion and ideological discourse&rdquo; (p. 40) in Assyria. She is careful to highlight that she focuses not only on Mesopotamia proper but also on those cultural interactions with Syrian and Anatolian cultures which influenced the ideology under inspection: in doing so, the author often mentions Urkesh and the publications by Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati. Chapters 2 to 4 outline chronologically the process by which the Assyrian ideological discourse came to life, from a historical (Chapter 2) cultural (Chapter 3) as well as ideological (Chapter 4) perspective. The following chapters (5 to 10) explore various issues in Assyrian royal ideology, and they are the most relevant and useful to compare with Buccellati&rsquo;s discourse on religion. Chapter 5 examines the royal titles and symbols connected to the Assyrian kings; chapter 6 analyzes the relationship between Assyrian royal ideology and myth - in particular with regard to the divine figure of Ninurta; chapter 7 considers the way in which royal inscriptions were used and included in the royal discourse and propaganda, while chapter 8 focuses on the intertextuality between historiographic texts and myths. Finally, chapter 9 investigates the issues of prophecy and divination compendia while chapter 10 discusses to what extent Assyrian cultic practice and rituals were used to reinforce or create the royal ideology. In the last chapter, 11, the author highlights the role of the scholars within the Assyrian kingship. The book also has two appendices, in which Pongratz-Leisten offers a transliteration, philological commentary and analysis of two Akkadian texts: LKA 62 and Rm 2, 455.
Several significant topics discussed by Buccellati are investigated in this book: two issues in particular will be mentioned here. Firstly, the <strong>nature and function of rituals</strong> (Buccellati&rsquo;s §13.1) and the <strong>relationship between religion and politics</strong> (Buccelati&rsquo;s §16.2), which are clearly very relevant issues in the history of the Neo-Assyrian empire. Overall, the examples provided by Pongratz-Leisten seems to confirm Buccellati&rsquo;s statements that «Religious rituals serve to institutionalize individual efforts to establish an interactive link with the divine element» (§13.1) - and that «religion is politics because it offers mechanisms that serve to give integration to the social group, and politics is religion because it offers an effective model of world integration.» (§16.2). In particular, Pongratz-Leisten&rsquo;s analysis of the <em>t&#257;kultu</em> and the <em>ak&#299;tu</em> rituals (in her §10.3.2, pp. 392ff and §10.5, pp. 416ff) strongly highlights the connections between royal ideology and the Neo-Assyrian cosmological view. «The Assyrian state rituals of the Sargonid period are a powerful mechanism for publicizing the <em>body politic</em> of the king in his cosmic function (…) <strong>Myth and ritual were a key part of cultural discourse and were as important as pragmatic action in the consolidation and stabilization of Assyrian power and control</strong>, both in the imperial heartland and in the provinces. Myth and ritual were powerful means for visualizing and negotiating the asymmetrical power relationships represented by the monarchical system, and (…) they were carefully orchestrated to reinforce the king&rsquo;s historical and cosmic role» (pp. 390-391).
The second significant issue discussed by the author is the Assyrian perception of <strong>polytheism</strong>, in particular at pp. 404-407. In this case, similarly to when Buccellati argues for an increasing development of a &ldquo;unity of the divine&rdquo; (§5.2; see also §3.2, §3.3 and §5.1) Pongratz-Leisten maintains that hyphenation in the Assyrian cultic context (e.g. Aššur-Adad, Aššur-Ninurta, Aššur-Enlil) should be understood as a variation of the theological &ldquo;summodeism&rdquo;, i.e. «a form of theism in which <strong>deities are regarded as aspects or functions of a chief god</strong>, with political power often key to its expression (…) Polytheism reflects this kind of coherent system of action (Handlungssystem) in which every divinity contributes according to their skill-set to guarantee the functioning of the cosmic order (…) In the summodeism of the god lists or hymns of the first millennium BC, the accumulation of various roles, functions, and qualities in one deity marks the developing consolidation of divine power in one divine agency.» (pp. 404-406)
Instead, one rather strong statement which is present in this volume and that goes against what is argued by Buccellati in §2.4 and §17.2 - as well as elsewhere in the volume -, is that «ancient Near Eastern knowledge is primarily practical rather than moral or philosophical» (pp. 273-274). The author uses this argument to discuss the royal ideological discourse on knowledge developed over time, in particular by Esarhaddon, to legitimize kingship. Unfortunately, however, she does not develop further this statement nor does she describe her own perception of &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; and &ldquo;morality&rdquo;, particularly when applied to Ancient Mesopotamia.</p>

        <p>The author&rsquo;s reflection arises from the question of whether the notion of the &lsquo;holy&rsquo; is an adequate concept to apply to ancient Near Eastern religions, their world view and their cult. Pongratz-Leisten also reflects upon the issue of the &lsquo;translatability of cultures&rsquo;: at first, she surveys some examples of former Biblical and ancient Near Eastern scholarship on the topic of her interest - then, she focuses on the Sumerian lexicon to show how the perception of the &lsquo;temple&rsquo; changed over time, in the history of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the author takes into consideration the Biblical studies (pp. 409-411), analysing how they dealt with the topics of cult and holiness in a comparative perspective with the Mesopotamian studies (412-416) and with frequent and relevant references to anthropological studies.</p>
<p>In the second part of the article, Pongratz-Leisten presents a detailed analysis of the Sumerian and Akkadian terminology used to qualify the Mesopotamian temple, its building materials and its segregation from the &lsquo;external world&rsquo; by means of purification rites and extispicy. Her aim is to investigate what defines the isolated and sacred quality of the temple and which lexicon was used to denote this peculiar status in Sumerian and Akkadian written sources.</p>

        <p><br><br>The seven contributions gathered in the present volume, which emphasize but are not limited to case studies on the ancient Near East, are intended to address key research questions in the religious and anthropological fields, including the <strong>relationship between the divine and its material presence</strong>, the &ldquo;production&rdquo; of the divine presence and its <strong>agency</strong>, visual representation of the divine and <strong>anthropomorphism</strong>. The book is divided in three parts. <br><br>
Part I is dedicated to &ldquo;The material divine: Anthropomorphism, animation, and agency in cross-cultural perspective&rdquo; and it is introduced by a paper written by the two editors in which they treat the conceptualization of the terms &lsquo;divine&rsquo;, &lsquo;sacred&rsquo;, and &lsquo;presence&rsquo;, and discuss the animating of divine images and presencing of the divine. Then, a contribution from C. Walker Bynum offers a critical assessment of generalized cognitive models of and explanations for the anthropomorphizing and animation of holy things, taking the Christian Eucharist during the later Middle Ages in Europe as a case study.<br><br>
Parts II shifts the focus on &ldquo;Divine materials, materiality, and materialization in Mesopotamia&rdquo;. The contribution by K. Benzel explores both the inherent properties and attributed qualities of materials such as gold and silver, which in ancient Mesopotamia could actively produce or create - rather than merely reflect or reproduce - the divine. Taking first millennium BC texts that describe divine bodies and body parts as case study, Pongratz-Leisten&rsquo;s paper explores the attribution of composite anthropomorphic forms to deities as a means of articulating the power of unified divine agency. K. Sonik examines in her contribution the construction of the anthropomorphic divine body in Mesopotamia and the implications and associations of physical and behavioral anthropomorphism.<br><br>
In Part III of the volume, the contributions explore &ldquo;Visual and auditory engagement with the divine and divine agents in the ancient Near East&rdquo;. D.E. Fleming, taking the zukru festival in the city of Emar as his case study, examines the non-verbal communication established between worshipers and the god Dagan. A.-C. Rendu-Loisel analyzes exorcistic rituals from the first millennium BC, focusing on the element of noise and discussing how divine or supernatural presence could be produced or rendered tangible.<br><br>
Overall, the volume provides significant insights from the disciplines of anthropology, archaeology, art history, and sociology inside the scope of ancient Near Eastern studies. Its seven contributions offer an interesting spectrum of investigations on <strong>materiality and divine agency</strong>, mostly (though not exclusively) from the perspective of ancient Mesopotamia studies.</p>

        <p>In the Introduction to this volume (“I Believe – Amen”), Joseph Ratzinger discusses to topic of the explanation of <strong>faith</strong> in relationship with <strong>reason</strong>, addressing a question related to doubts in believing. </p>
<p><em>Chapters 1-3</em> are devoted to the origin of doubts in faith, to the origin of belief, and to the problem of believing today, in <em>Chapter 4</em> the author analyses the relationship between science and religion, discussing the birth of the historical approach in the analysis of religion, the “turn toward technical thinking”, and “the question of the place of belief”. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em> describes faith as “standing firm and understanding”, focusing of the concept of the need of believing to fully access religious world and the understanding of the faith in God. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 6, the most relevant for the discussion on the relationship between faith and reason, focuses on “the rationality of faith”: &laquo;[…] “Amen” simply says once again in its own way what belief means: the trustful placing of myself on a ground that upholds me, not because I have made it and checked it by my own calculations but, rather, precisely because I have not made it and cannot check it. [&hellip;] Yet what happens here is not a blind surrender to the irrational. On the contrary, it is a movement toward the </em>logos<em>, the </em>ratio<em>, toward meaning and so toward truth itself, for in the final analysis the ground on which man takes his stand cannot possibly be anything else but the truth revealing itself. […] In other words, it is certainly true that belief or faith is not knowledge in the sense of practical knowledge and its particular kind of calculability. […] But the reverse is also true: calculable practical knowledge is limited by its very nature to the apparent, to what functions, and does not represent the way in which to find truth itself, which by its very method it has renounced. The tool with which man is equipped to deal with the truth of being is not </em>knowledge<em> but </em>understanding<em>: understanding of the meaning to which he has entrusted himself. [&hellip;] I think this is the precise significance of what we mean by understanding: that we learn to grasp the ground on which we have taken our stand as meaning and truth; that we learn to perceive that </em>ground<em> represents </em>meaning*. If this is so, understanding not only implies no contradiction with belief but represents its most intrinsic property&raquo; (pp. 40-41). </p>
<p><em>Chapter 7</em> discusses the personal belief in God, underlining the personal character of such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>[The question of the relationship between <strong>faith</strong> and <strong>reason</strong> (raised by G. Buccellati in Chapter 1, Section 8) finds here an eminent answer. According to Ratzinger, faith and reason are based on two different methods (the former focusing of “understanding” of the <em>logos</em>, the latter on the scientific explanation of verifiable phenomena). Nevertheless, faith is not reasonless, since the aim of the believer is the “understanding” of the hidden meaning (“mystery”) of <em>logos</em> which(/who) is analysable by means of a logical and reasonable process, following criteria different from the logic of science but, anyhow, reasonable at all. Here, the opinion of the author can be compared with that of G. Buccellati, both focusing of the concepts of “understanding” and “explanation” of faith/spirituality.]</p>

        <p>This article focuses on the role of the <strong>apkallus</strong>, or the &ldquo;<strong>Seven Sages</strong>&rdquo;, in Assyriological literature. Reiner translates texts that describes the qualities and origin of each sage: K.5119, Ki 1904-10-9,87, K 7987, and LKA 76. A distinction in the genesis of the apkallus is suggested ranging from human descent, fish, birds, and being &ldquo;grown&rdquo; in the river. Reiner notes differentiation in textual arrangements, and argues the mentioning of the sages serves an <strong>apotropaic</strong> function, additionally evidenced in the archaeological record as <strong>apkallu-figurines</strong> - sometimes as fish. Apkallus are thought to gift humanity with civilization and craft specialization, as described by <strong>Berossus</strong>.  Reiner cites convoluted interpretations with regard to distinctions between the epitaphs of early kings and apkallus. Reiner suggests a shared Near Eastern milieu that associated a &ldquo;person of superior wisdom with a famous king&rdquo;. Fluctuation of the usage and context of the terms <strong><em>ummanu</em></strong> and apkallu is thought to adduce the role of the &ldquo;<strong>wise vizier</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;wise men&rdquo;. Reiner states her explicit opinion that the role of the tales of apkallus may serve an etiological function, in that they represent &ldquo;old sages from before the flood&rdquo;. Interestingly, the texts Reiner examines illustrates the apkallus as cosmic dissidents who supplement humanity with divine knowledge. </p>

Dietrich), who reclaims about the exemptions granted to the cities of Sippar, Nippur and Babylon, which were probably negated by the king. The sender of the letter (similar to another letter from Ashurbanipal’s library at Nineveh, 12 N 110, published by M. Civil in the Appendix, pp. 324-326), reports some phrases of the <em>Fürstenspiegel</em> to persuade the king to reinstate the traditional exemptions, thus avoiding the divine wrath.</p>
<p>[This letter shows how ancient Mesopotamian people used sentences taken from wisdom literature in other ‘genres’, such as letters to the king, to strengthen their demands in front of their sovereign.]</p>

        <p>In an interpretation of his excavations at the island of Keros in the Cyclades, the author proposes a distinction between ritual and cult, in the following sense: cult, being equated with religion, entails the recognition of individual deities, and ritual can exist without cult or religion (pp. 21-24 and 42-44). The island of Keros served as a «symbolic attractor», one that favored, through ritual, the «convocation and congregation» of individuals from other islands. As such, it is the first «pan-Cycladic» sanctuary, a maritime sanctuary where intentionally broken objects were taken and deposited. The cycladic marble figures may have been the symbol of this «coherent participating community, a koine», or, in fact, the «symbolic representative, the &lsquo;logo&rsquo;, of Keros and of the Cycladic community for which Keros was the ritual and pilgrimage center» (p. 42).</p>

        <p>The author investigates the textual, iconographic, and archaeological evidence of northern Mesopotamia in the mid-third millennium BCE, as this is considered to be an arena which saw an important cultural revolution that transformed how people within nascent states understood their communities. This article in particular aims to explore <strong>the power dynamics that led to inclusive and exclusive political strategies and free and limited access to political and ritual spaces in cities and in the countryside</strong>.
In the first section of this paper, Ristvet focuses on how building programs in northern Mesopotamia created specific spaces that at the same time expressed and established royal power. Then, issues connected to <strong>ritual travel and pilgrimage</strong> and their connections with the negotiation of political authority in early states are discussed. The author aims to prove that <strong>processions and pilgrimages were crucial to the development of a cognitive schema that made sense of the newly created polities</strong>. Indeed, Ristvet argues that «The rise of the state coincided with the creation of a complex religious landscape, where multiple pilgrimage routes arose which probably coincided with, and sometimes cross-cut, the territories of specific polities.» (p. 8).</p>

He concludes that &laquo;not even the most submissive and conscientious obedience to the divine will could guarantee the desired blessings&ndash;covenant or no covenant. <strong>The good man sometimes suffered while the wicked man prospered</strong>, and as a result of this observation, drawn from the actual experience of life, some thinkers in Mesopotamia as well as Israel, moved toward a more profound view of the relationship between obedience and the divine blessings. Man in the finiteness of his knowledge and power was simply unable to strip the deity of his freedom. This insight is most clearly stated in the wisdom literature of both cultures, but at least a rudimentary awareness of its truth can be detected even in the more strictly cultic texts of both Israel and Mesopotamia.&raquo; (p. 187).  </p>

        <p>In the opening paragraph of this article, F. Rochberg offers a synthetic yet significant overview on the application of the idea of &ldquo;science&rdquo; to Mesopotamian divination by scholars across time. She highlights how «Because the diverse systems of Mesopotamian divination all stemmed from a belief in the gods&rsquo; involvement in the physical, as well as the social worlds, and because of the close relationship of divination to apotropaic ritual magic, the body of knowledge represented by the omen texts has not always been classified as science, particularly by historians of science who prefer to see in this material a form of pre- or proto-science.» (p. 560)</p>
<p>Rochberg&rsquo;s purpose, however, is to ascertain the criteria of observation implied by omen texts in order to evaluate the &ldquo;empirical&rdquo; nature of Mesopotamian divination. In order to do so, she assess an important methodological approach (which is very similar to the one advocated by Buccellati): modern scholars must «strive not to distort ancient systems of thought by the imposition of our own definitions and criteria and may try to determine the content, aims, and methods of such systems &ldquo;from within&rdquo;. (&hellip;) Though our classification of Mesopotamian divination as &ldquo;science&rdquo; probably would make no sense to a Babylonian, it serves to make comprehensible to us some aspects of this ancient intellectual tradition by connoting a number of features: among them, empiricism and systematization of knowledge.» (p. 561)</p>

        <p>Rochberg&rsquo;s main research question is whether there has ever been an idea of a divine unity, a &ldquo;monotheism&rdquo;, within the ancient Mesopotamian view of the relation between the divine and heaven. Ultimately, Rochberg gives a negative answer to such question. She states that the fact that cuneiform texts never address this topic confirms that the idea of a universal, divine &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; was not present in Mesopotamian theologies.</p>
<p>By analyzing a few Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian texts, however, she investigates the relation between the the gods and the stars, as the connection between the heavens and the divine was indeed present and continuous in the Mesopotamian religion. Though heaven was never considered as divine in itself, gods were indeed associated or even identified with heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>&laquo;Polytheism itself forestalled a unified view of &ldquo;cosmos&rdquo;, in favor of cosmic regions that were divinized and drafted into mythological stories.&raquo; (p. 119) Rochberg also takes into consideration the Sumerian term &#352;&#193;R (present in several divine names, such as the divine pair AN.&#352;&#193;R  and KI.&#352;&#193;R), whose meaning &ldquo;totality&rdquo; (= Akkadian <em>ki&#353;&#353;atu</em>) she derives not from the idea of &ldquo;oneness&rdquo;, but of &ldquo;many&rdquo; - and therefore connoted a unity comprised of plurality.</p>
<p>Then, she analyzes the cuneiform signs used to designate the term &lsquo;god&rsquo; (i.e. the sign AN, consisting in the image of a eight-pointed star) as well as the term &lsquo;star&rsquo; (the sign MUL, which was made of three AN-signs thus recalling a constellation). In Rochberg&rsquo;s view, there were two modes of referring to the divinity of the heavenly bodies in cuneiform sources: in the first one (which she labels &ldquo;embodiment&rdquo;), gods were referred to or spoken of as celestial bodies - conversely, in the second one (called &ldquo;representation&rdquo;) celestial bodies were referred to as gods.</p>
<p>With regard to transcendence and immanence, Rochberg writes: &laquo;<strong>It may be tempting to appeal to notions of transcendence and immanence when trying to characterize the Babylonian theology, which gives rise to images of the divine and its relation to the universe. I think, however, that it is ultimately not very helpful</strong>. Though the word <em>transcendence</em> can certainly have a nontheological usage - said of something that is above and beyond in excellence, even otherworldly - its usual connotations are religious, specifically Christian, and refer to the excellence and otherworldliness of God and the notion of God as being above and outside the universe, his creation. <em>Immanence</em>, on the other hand, can also pertain to things in general; etymologically, &ldquo;being within&rdquo; or not exceeding a given domain. But in a religious context, again mostly Christian, immanence connotes the existence or presence of God inside creation, within the world. <strong>It would be misleading to import theological notions such as these into ancient Mesopotamia or somehow to shape the ideas contained in cuneiform texts into this mold</strong>.&raquo; (p. 133)</p>

        <p>&laquo;This paper views the relevance of cuneiform texts to the <strong>history of science</strong> from inside, i.e., from the perspective of the available sources, as well as from outside, i.e., from the perspective of historians of science outside the field of Assyriology. It reviews some of the methodological problems that beset the reconstruction of science in the ancient Near East as well as a way forward, which acknowledges localism and pluralism as well the compelling continuity from cuneiform traditions of knowledge to later counterparts <strong>(astronomy, astrology, magic, astral-medicine</strong>). Cuneiform texts will not instantiate a universal or transcultural science but are essential if science is to be seen as embedded in culture and history&raquo; (author’s abstract on <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/janeh/1/1/article-p37.xml?tab_body=abstract">publisher’s webpage</a>.</p>

        <p>Rochberg investigates the nature of &ldquo;canon&rdquo; in ancient Mesopotamian text: she identifies the ultimate roots of the term &lsquo;canon&rsquo; in reference to a set of authoritative authors or text in the ancient Near East, tracing the roots of the Greek term back to the Akkadian <em>qan&#251;</em> &ldquo;reed&rdquo; or &ldquo;measuring rod&rdquo;. Indeed, in ancient Mesopotamian Art the very principle of rightness and conformity with principle was conveyed by the image of a god holding out in the direction of the king the rod and the ring: the gods who held those symbols were capable of selecting a ruler who would represent divine order on the earth.</p>
<p>Since the term &ldquo;canon&rdquo; was later applied to a set of divinely inspired texts in the Judeo-Christian world, Rochberg identifies the bridge between the ancient Mesopotamian tradition and the early Church Fathers&rsquo; application of this same term in the texts belonging to the Mesopotamian &ldquo;scribal scholarship&rdquo;, and in particular celestial omens and related texts. In first millennium BCE Mesopotamia, these texts came to be accepted as authoritative, and scribal knowledge became associated with antediluvian sages.</p>
<p>Rochberg explores several critical issues connected with the idea of canonicity, including the relationship between orality and writing for canonical texts, taking into consideration several types of sources through time. She also investigates the possibility of variations and innovation within canonical texts, maintaning that though &laquo;the idea of a commitment to maintaining the connection to the past as well as to the divine, to continue preserving knowledge and the scribal arts, and to keep it within bounds of members of the educated elite, are all aspects of canonicity in the cuneiform scholastic context&raquo; (p. 223), a range of internal variation was still possible. &laquo;Texts did not become canonical by being standardized, but rather became standardized (or relatively standardized) because they had the force of authority for a community of scribes. The canonicity (&hellip;) was held in common, though for different reasons, by the schoolmasters of the <em>edubba</em> and the scribes.&raquo; (p. 225)</p>
<p>Rochberg, thus, identifies the ultimate origin of canonicity in the restricted circles of Near Eastern scholars and scribes, who gave authority to the written compositions; she also claims that in Mesopotamia - as in all other human societies - &laquo;the canon of texts (or images, or any other canonical cultural form) has its status by virtue of its ability to communicate living ideas&raquo;, thus transcending the needs of a single individual or community.</p>

        <p>This article investigates different manifestations of the <strong>divine wrath</strong> in the Hebrew Bible. <strong>God’s anger seems to be at the origin of his name</strong>, according to Wellhausen, deriving this conclusion from the root “h-w-h”. It would be fitting, then, that a god of the tempest would be named Yhwh.</p>
<p>The wrath is an attribute of the <strong>warrior god</strong>, and Yhwh is often depicted in this function. But Yhwh’s wrath is also directed against his own people. This is the case in the book of Job and 2 Sam 24. Here Yhwh’s wrath appears arbitrary and incomprehensible. For that reason later redactors have interpreted this manifestation of divine anger through the figure of <strong>Satan</strong>. See <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hamidovic2015Mastema">Hamidovic 2015 Mastema</a>.</p>
<p>In the deuteronomistic ideology, Yhwh’s wrath is the ‘logical’ consequence of the people’s and their king’s misconduct. Yhwh’s wrath manifests itself in the destruction of Jerusalem. It is important as a sort of <strong>theodicy</strong> which indicates that <strong>Yhwh was not beaten by the gods of the Babylonians</strong>, but rather was himself the origin of the disaster that befell Israel.</p>
<p>This theology of retribution raises the question whether Yhwh’s wrath can be suspended or whether he can change his mind, and this issue is reflected in the re-reading of the prophets after the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The book of Jonah gives an ambiguous answer to this question. On one hand, it would seem to suggest the <strong>universalism of faith in Yhwh</strong>, and God’s mercy. But the reader in the third century BCE would know that Ninevah was in fact destroyed: so perhaps the message is that <strong>repentance does not mean that one can escape the consequences of one’s actions</strong>. R&ouml;mer concludes, &laquo;Yhwh can change his mind, but not definitively.&raquo; (p. 324)</p>

        <p>Taking the famous passage written by Herodotus on sacred prostitution in Babylonian temples as a starting point, Roth sets out to investigate the social and legal tensions between marriage and nonmarital relations - thus also confronting what she calls the «specter of the &ldquo;sacred prostitute&rdquo; raised by Herodotus» which, she believes, needs «to be eliminated from the discussion.» (p. 23). Drawing similar conclusions than the ones stated by Goodnick Westenholz in 1989 (cf. <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Westenholz1989Tamar">Westenholz 1989 Tamar</a>), Roth writes: «It is clear that, other than this highly restricted and structured &ldquo;sacred marriage,&rdquo; there was no ritualized or institutionalized sexual intercourse associated with Mesopotamian religions or temples. Neither female nor male cultic personnel, thether linked ritually or only lexically (&hellip;), can be identified as female or male prostitutes or catamites.» (pp. 23-24).</p>

        <p>&laquo;Divination was one facet of that complex in Mesopotamia’s early historical periods. This elaborate system of knowledge claimed the ability to read and interpret the signs putatively encoded by the gods in the fabric of the phenomenal world: the entrails of a sheep, earthquakes, happenings in the sky, facets of the urban landscape and city life, the days in the calendar, medical symptoms, the appearance of the human body as well as birth defects, human sexual habits, dreams, and myriad other domains of experience […]. In the present article I will look at one type of divination in particular, <strong>extispicy</strong>, the practice of reading and interpreting the entrails of a sacriﬁcial animal, known already from the Bible and identiﬁed early on in cuneiform tablets in the 1870s &raquo; (from p. 98).</p>

        <p>Schenker defines <strong>monotheism</strong> as the transcendence of one god over the others, not necessarily the complete non-existence of other gods. &laquo;In order to speak of monotheism in truth, it is sufficient that there be a face-to-face between a unique god on one hand and all the other divine beings on the other.&raquo; (p. 438) He proceeds to examine three texts that support his thesis. </p>
<p>(1) Dt 32:8-9, which evokes a plurality of national religions, each with a national god, but over which ‘elyon  (who is the same as YHWH, in Schenker’s view) presides. Therefore, &laquo;by recognizing and adoring their gods, the nations indirectly recognize and adore YHWH&raquo; (p. 441).</p>
<p>(2) Mi 4:5, which looks toward the eschatological end of religions.  There are numerous religions, the passage claims, but the other gods will only exist for a time, while YHWH will live for ever.</p>
<p>(3) Ps 82 is most correctly interpreted as a pantheon of gods who have been unfaithful to their task, and have caused disorder. This solution implies that the poor governance is not imputable to YHWH, and solves the problem of theodicy. (See also <a href=”bibl-quando.hrm#Mastema”> Mastema</a>).</p>
<p>Schenker concludes that these texts taken together attribute a double transcendence to one god: he transcends both the realm of men and that of a divine pantheon of lesser gods. However, that pantheon is also properly ‘divine’, insofar as it is above the human realm. (See <a href=”bibl-quando.hrm#Smith2001”>Smith</a>’s book, which is ambiguous on this point: &laquo;what is an ilu (god)&raquo;). For Schenker, it is a &laquo;simultaneously monotheistic and polytheistic conception that we see affirmed in these texts.&raquo; (p. 445). For mostly onomastic reasons, he believes there was a &laquo;monotheism of transcendence in Israel before the exile.&raquo; (p. 448) </p>
<p>Schenker also connects the existence of a pantheon of gods to the celestial court that would later be known as <strong>angels</strong>.  </p>

        <p>&laquo;This investigation aims to ascertain whether or not the Israelites believed in the <strong>supernatural beneficent power of the dead</strong>. First, a lexicon of selected mortuary practices and beliefs is outlined. In the Israelite context, those rites most likely to reflect this belief are <strong>necromancy</strong> and those which fall within the purview of the <strong>ancestor cult</strong> intended to express veneration or worship of the ancestors (ch. 1). Secondly, an evaluation of the <strong>relevant texts from Syria-Palestine</strong> of the third to first millennia B.C.E. demonstrates that a longstanding West Semitic or Canaanite origin for Israel&rsquo;s belief in the supernatural beneficent power of the dead cannot be established on the basis of these data (chs. 2 and 3). Thirdly, an examination of the <strong>Hebrew Bible</strong> demonstrates that while a concern to care for or commemorate the dead might be inferred, neither an ancestor cult nor ancestor veneration or worship in particular can be established on the basis of the available literary (or material) evidence. Moreover, while necromancy is occasionally attested, the relevant passages which polemicize against Israel&rsquo;s embrace of this practice originate either in the last days of the Judahite monarchy or, more likely, during the exile itself. The historical reality which gave rise to this polemical tradition was the threat which <strong>Mesopotamian religion and magic</strong> beginning with the Neo-Assyrian period posed to later (dtr?) Yahwism (ch. 4). Comparative <strong>ethnographic data</strong> suggests that the longstanding absence of the belief in the beneficent dead in Israel and Syria-Palestine might be partially explained as a reaction to the pervasive <strong>fear of the dead</strong>. Nevertheless, once this belief was embraced by late Israelite society, owing to contemporary developments in politics (Mesopotamian hegemony), economics (depletion of resources), and religion (popularity of divination), necromancy, not ancestor veneration or worship, presented itself as the preferred ritual expression of this belief (conclusion)&raquo; (author’s abstract).</p>
<p>The thesis offers, through 4 chapters, many hints to ancestor cults and necromantic practices in Israel, in comparison to other similar Mesopotamian rituals. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 1</em> introduces the topic of mortuary practices in ancient Near East. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em> focuses on extra-biblical and Syro-Palestinian textual evidence from the late third to early second millennia BC: <em>sub-paragraph 2.1</em> describes documents from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla"><strong>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</strong></a> (Eblaite king list, offering lists, lamentations, the Eblaite version of the <strong><em>marzēaḥ</em></strong>), also dealing with Eblaite ancestral gods and the cult of the dead, together with the specific role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resheph"><strong>Rashap</strong></a>, the god of the Underworld; <em>sub-paragraph 2.2</em> focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria"><strong>Mari</strong></a>’s documentation, presenting the <strong><em>kispum</em></strong> ritual (and its parallel with the <strong><em>pagrā‘um</em></strong> rituals), the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagon"><strong>Dagan</strong></a>, the god of <em>pagrū</em>, and the cult of the dead unified <strong><em>Itūr-Mer</em></strong>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 3</em> deals with extra-biblical and Syro-Palestinian textual evidence from the mid to late second millennium BC third to early Second millennium BC, comparing elements from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit"><strong>Ugarit/Ras Shamra</strong></a> (Dagan’s stelae, <em>kispum</em>-like offering texts, the Ugaritic king list, the Ugaritic version of the <em>marzēaḥ</em> and of the <em>kispum</em>, analysing the role of the god <strong><em>‘Il ’ib</em></strong> and of the Ugaritic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite"><strong><em>Rp’um</em></strong></a>), from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuzi"><strong>Nuzi</strong></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emar"><strong>Emar/Tell Meskene</strong></a>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em> describes the evidence from the <strong>Hebrew Bible</strong>: <em>sub-paragraph 4.1</em> concerns the supposed ‘Canaanite’ origins of ancestor cults and necromancy in Israel; <em>sub-paragraph 4.2</em> investigates the extra-biblical Syro-Palestinian evidence of the first millennium BC; <em>sub-paragraph 4.3</em> focuses on the <strong>pre-exilic prophetic literature</strong>, while <em>sub-paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5</em> deals with the <strong>Deuteronomic legal material</strong>, and with the <strong>Deuteronomistic history</strong>, respectively; <em>sub-paragraph 4.6</em> involves the <strong>exilic and post-exilic prophetic literature</strong>, and <em>sub-paragraph 4.7</em> ends the chapter focusing on the Israelite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite"><strong><em>Repha’im</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>[The author underlines correspondences (and even differences) between Biblical and Syro-Mesopotamian cultic and mortuary practices, basing on a sound philological analysis of the written sources of both the areas, reaching intriguing anthropological explanations for specific phenomena.]</p>

        <p>This volume, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schmidt_(archaeologist)">Klaus Schmidt</a>, director of excavations at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a> (cf. <a href="https://www.dainst.org/projekt/-/project-display/21890">DAINST</a>) from 1996 to 2014, describes the discovery of this ancient prehistorical site in South-Eastern Anatolia, comparing it with other similar structures or with different archaeological sites in other country of the Middle-Near East. </p>
<p>The purpose of the volume is to highlight the development and emergence of religious/spiritual thought (and its connection to agriculture) in a ‘society’ (I mean with this term simply a group of people) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Pottery_Neolithic_A">Pre-Pottery Neolithic A</a> period (i.e. ca. 10000-8800 BC).  </p>
<p>The volume develops in a narrative way, retracing the paths of the discovery and excavation of the site.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 1</em> describes the beginning of investigation in the area of the site.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em> presents comparisons with other prehistorical and proto-historical sites like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho"><strong>Jericho</strong></a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilly_Flanks"><strong>“Hilly Flanks”</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Ain_Ghazal"><strong>‘Ain Ghazal</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofnet_Caves"><strong>Ofnet Caves</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk"><strong>Çatalhöyük</strong></a> (cf. entry: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hodder2010Emergence">Hodder 2010 Emergence</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87ay%C3%B6n%C3%BC"><strong>Çayönü</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neval%C4%B1_%C3%87ori"><strong>Nevali Çori</strong></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCrc%C3%BCtepe"><strong>Gürcütepe</strong></a>, dealing with topics related to <strong>cultic activities</strong> and <strong>funerary practices</strong> in pre-urban (i.e. hunting-gathering groups) and proto-urban societies.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 3</em> focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a>, describing the structures and meaning of its first megalithic, circular structures, with the typical <strong>“T-shape stelae/pillars”</strong>, interpreted as early ‘shrines’ (probably hypetral), representing a meeting places for hunting-gathering people where <strong>cultic activities</strong> were performed (also probably connected to <strong>ancestor cult</strong> and <strong>funerary practices</strong>).   </p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em> investigates the meaning of the animals (snakes, foxes, oxen, cranes, leopards, lions, <em>et al.</em>) and other human-entities represented on the <strong>“T-shape stelae/pillars”</strong>, comparing them with other depictions at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaca_Da%C4%9F"><strong>Karacadağ</strong></a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara"><strong>Sahara</strong></a> (spiders, millipedes, a “goat demon”, “dog-head demons”), advancing comparisons with other Neolithic sites (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge"><strong>Stonehenge</strong></a>), or other pillars elsewhere (such as the Egyptian obelisks). The aim of this comparison is to better understand the meaning of these representations in the <strong>cultural memory</strong> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age"><strong>Stone Age</strong></a> communities. Three further considerations are advanced: 1) the possibility of interpreting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a> as the Sumerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du-Ku"><strong>Du-Ku</strong> mount</a>; 2) the analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a>’s depictions are <strong>proto-petroglyphs</strong>; 3) the possible retrieving of <strong>totemic/shamanic beliefs</strong> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a>.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em> analyses two topics: <em>paragraph 1</em> describes the more recent structures, peculiarly the “Building with the lion-pillar”, dealing with specific human representations (sometimes with ithyphallic men or women with <em>macronymphia</em>); this passage from the representation of wild animals to the depiction of human beings is interpreted (following a suggestion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cauvin">Jacques Cauvin</a>) as a possible connection to fertility, &laquo;a transformation denoting the passage from a hunting-gathering society to a food-producing society, i.e. based on agriculture’ (p. 228; English translation by mDP). <em>Paragraph 2</em> focuses on the relationships between hunting-gathering human groups and the early agricultural societies (and the passage from dispersal occupations to villages and later to cities), describing the cultic/religious function (as a ‘proto-shrine’) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a>’s buildings, and the relationship of agriculture (as a cause or a consequence) with the development of a religious thought.</p>
<p>[The contribution is particularly relevant as an introduction to the first attested forms of religiosity and rituals in the ancient site of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"><strong>Göbekli Tepe</strong></a>, in South-Eastern Anatolia. The ability of the author consists in outlining through the stones of these prehistorical structures a possible religious explanation for the construction of these first ‘shrines’, an explanation which benefits also from anthropological theories.]</p>

        <p>The author collects in this volume, divided into 7 chapters, many data from ancient cuneiform sources related to <strong>Mesopotamian deities</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 1</em> describes the modern classification of the various types of <strong>gods</strong>, analysing their formal and functional entity and comparing the ancient and the modern perspective on divinities.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em> focuses on the modern systematic classification of Mesopotamian gods according to the ancient <strong>lists of gods</strong>.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 discusses the figure of the Semitic god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad"><strong>Hadda</strong></a> as he is described in ancient sources and according to his iconographical and statuary depictions, describing his main places of worshipping.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em> displays an analysis of the Sumerian god <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ishkur"><strong>Iškur</strong></a>, deriving from Ur III period’s sources, describing his main worshipping places (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qarqar">Karkar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girsu">Girsu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umma">Umma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippur">Nippur</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur">Ur</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk">Uruk</a>), presenting a list of the main rituals performed for him, retracing the composition of his own divine family, and discussing the interpretation of this god as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad"><strong>Adda</strong>/<strong>Addu</strong>/<strong>Adad</strong></a> (in the Babylonian culture), or as other local gods.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em> deals with the diffusion of the cult of <strong>Addu</strong> in the Upper Mesopotamia, in Babylonia, and in the Susiana, describing his main temples (with an insight on his respective consorts).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 6</em> exposes the later syncretism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad"><strong>Haddu (Addu/Adad)</strong></a> with the gods <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teshub"><strong>Teššub</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal"><strong>Ba’alu</strong></a> in Upper Mesopotamia and in Northern Syria, including both Hurrian and Hittite traditions.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 7</em> moves to more recent periods, describing the figure of the god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad"><strong>Adad</strong></a> in the Neo-Assyrian period, displaying the actual pantheon of that culture, and locating the most important temples of this god in Assyria, Babylonia, Elam, and Persia, retracing the paths towards a new interpretation of this god in the literature of that time.</p>
<p>Some <em>indices</em> conclude the volume, referring to the main epithets of <strong>Iškur-Adad</strong> in the Sumerian and Akkadian dictionaries, adding at the very end a copy of the most important cuneiform texts related to this god.  </p>
<p>[The volume displays many different divine figures of the Syro-Mesopotamian pantheon, mostly focusing on the Storm-god, underlining how in many cases different gods were merged into one singular divine entity through a process of syncretism. The contribution represents a clear exemplification of the complexity of the Syro-Mesopotamian religious thought.]</p>

If so, then a glance at the large body of cuneiform texts that have survived from three millennia of Mesopotamian history leads us to an extensive group of Sumerian and Akkadian texts that Babylonians and Assyrians regarded as falling within the competence of an expert called in Akkadian <em>ašipu</em> or <em>mašmaššu</em> (conventionally translated ‘exorcist’)&raquo; (p. 418).</p>

        <p>The starting point of this paper is the analysis of two Akkadian texts (the Uruk Prophecy and the Dynastic Prophecy) which employ a phraseology that may be compared with the Biblical book of Daniel. In the opening paragraphs, while considering the possible similarity between Mesopotamian forms of communication with the gods and biblical prophecy Scurlock offers a synthesis of the comparative studies, stating: &laquo;That a repositioning into their original Mesopotamian context might require a re-evaluation of theologically significant biblical texts is a reason to embrace, not to avoid, comparison.&raquo; (p. 277) However, rather than making a distinction between a message from God directly delivered from a living person and something which makes predictions in the form of a written composition (as it was often the case in Mesopotamia), Scurlock suggests to create sub-categories within the designation &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo;, to reflect the potentially significant differences between oral and written forms of the phenomenon (p. 277, fn. 2).</p>
<p>With regards to the specific case of Mesopotamian &ldquo;prophecies&rdquo; which actually refer to events that have, in fact, already occurred, Scurlock goes against the idea of regarding them as false prophecy or political propaganda and suggests a new approach which inverts the paradigm and asks not whether Mesopotamian divination can represent a form of prophecy, but whether biblical prophecy can represent a form of divination. The question, then, would be whether prophecy involves not only the present and the future but also the past.</p>
<p>Scurlock identifies similarities in Mesopotamian and biblical prophecies in their using past historical events affecting the community to divine the will of God; in the existence of procedures that could be used to avert divine wrath and the evil consequences that would follow; and in the presence of solicited and unsolicited omens (so much so that historical events could be seen as part of a code whereby Yahweh communicated with his people and could, therefore, be used to decode and validate other messages delivered by other means, as by direct vision).</p>
<p>Ultimately, then, the scholar maintains that the Uruk Prophecy and the Dynastic Prophecy might be qualified as prophetic texts in the biblical sense. However, she also identifies a significant difference in the fact that the Bible has a inherently universal quality, whereas the Mesopotamian textss are typically geograhically and culturally focused on a particular city-state (Uruk or Babylon in the two case-studies considered here).</p>

        <p>&laquo;<em>Enūma eliš</em> is one of the few Akkadian texts that are relatively well known beyond the cryptic domain of the Assyriologist. The “popularity” of <em>Enūma eliš</em> seems to relate, at least in part, to one of its most transparent themes, namely, the creation of the universe. An emphasis on the etiological aspect of the composition appears already in George Smith’s translation entitled <em>The Chaldean Account of Genesis</em> published in 1876 […]. The creation story was thus the means to convey, proclaim, and justify the enthronement of <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html">Marduk</a> as Babylonia’s main deity. The glorification of Marduk is so forceful that the poet has him take over <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/enlil/index.html">Enlil</a>’s role as head of the pantheon. This was achieved progressively throughout the text, first by suggesting Marduk’s righteous genealogy, then by presenting him as the hero who defeated Tiamat and fashioned the universe, and finally by granting Marduk <strong>fifty names</strong>. In this paper, I wish to address the structure of the section dealing with the fifty names and its function within the poem as a whole&raquo; (from p. 507).</p>
<p>[This paper helps in better understanding the topic of the names of Mesopotamian gods and the plurality of deities within the Sumerian and Akkadian pantheon, specifically focusing on the <strong>50 names of Marduk</strong>.]</p>

        <p>&laquo;Reports on <strong>dreams</strong> as well as <strong>dream-omina</strong> are common in ancient Egyptian literature. They reflect a tradition beginning in the second millennium BCE, which left its mark on Greek and Arabic literature. The issue of the present research is to find out whether the <strong>Egyptian influence</strong> is also evident in dreams in the Bible, particularly those presented as dreams of the Egyptian officials and of Pharaoh in the <strong>Joseph narrative</strong> (Gen 40-41). A comparison of these dreams with the Egyptian dream pattern shows that they have common features regarding the types of dream, their structure, methods of formulation, and ways of interpretation. There can be no doubt that the narratives of the dreams of the officials and of Pharaoh contain authentic Egyptian elements and features. These are drawn from various areas of life in ancient Egypt: the King’s court, landscape and nature, economy, mythology, religion, and magic. Even Egyptian words transliterated into Hebrew are interspersed in these narratives. Therefore, the biblical text cannot be properly understood without recognition of its Egyptian setting&raquo; (author’s abstract).</p>

        <p>Christian tradition interprets Genesis 3 as a &ldquo;fall&rdquo; and an &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;, whose nature is understood as disobedience or rebellion. Recent scholarship is critical of this view. Smith affirms that the biblical text itself seems to be first of all an etiology about the condition of serpents, women, and men in the world. He proposes that <strong>Genesis 3 focuses on a psychological representation of human nature as a trajectory from desire, through knowledge, to fear and difficulty</strong>. This trajectory then points to evil proper in chapters 4 and 6. </p>
<p>Smith points out that the <strong>knowledge of good and evil is present in the garden before evil is committed by humans</strong>, and the tree that represents this knowledge is desirable &ldquo;for making one wise&rdquo;. &ldquo;In Genesis desire, not evil, is the first term of the human person.&rdquo; A second term is fear, which &ldquo;follows in the wake of knowing good and evil&rdquo;. Finally, the outcome of the choices made by the man and the woman is &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;. For Smith, &ldquo;it is enough to indicate what the vocabulary of Genesis 3 does name in the human condition: not sin or disobedience or transgression, but desire, knowledge of good and evil, fear, desire again, and difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Smith&rsquo;s treatment is erudite and precise, but it seems to lack an adequate appreciation for the breakage that Genesis 4 and 6 describe. While not explicit in the text, the traditional reading of Genesis 3 as the breaking/fragmentation of the relationship between man and God does account for the subsequent fragmentation of interpersonal relations in Genesis 4. This is the alternative proposal in <em>When on high</em>: what one may call original sin seems to be the very origin of polytheism.] </p>

        <p>Smith&rsquo;s study <strong>downplays a radical difference between monotheism and polytheism</strong>. He believes that <strong>El was the original god of Isra-el, and was originally distinct from Yahweh</strong>. <strong>Monotheism, then, would seem to be the distillation of an older pantheon</strong>, in which one figure (Yahweh) was so emphasized that he eclipsed all others, including El. </p>
<p>According to Smith, the rhetoric of monotheism probably emerged shortly before the exile. &laquo;With the heightened importance of the national god and the centrality of the national shrine in Jerusalem, eventually both human and divine power coalesced into one central authority, serving both human monarch and divine king.&raquo; Foreign imperial powers also aided the push toward monotheism, in Smith&rsquo;s view. &laquo;Monotheistic claims made sense in a world where political boundaries or institutions no longer offered any middle ground. In its political and social reduction in the world, Israel elevated the terms of its understanding of its deity&rsquo;s mastery of the world. Thus, monotheism is not a new stage of religion but a new stage of rhetoric in a situation never known prior to the threat of exile.&raquo; </p>
<p>Smith claims that &laquo;within the Bible, monotheism is not a separate &laquo;stage&raquo; of religion in ancient Israel, as it is customarily regarded. It was in fact a kind of ancient rhetoric reinforcing Israel&rsquo;s exclusive relationship with its deity. <strong>Monotheism is a kind of inner community discourse</strong>. Smith objects that &laquo;biblical texts do not deny the power of other deities outside this &laquo;local&raquo; framework. This approach also tends to ignore biblical criticisms against polytheism and the claims of most scholars that Israel knew the cult of &lsquo;Yahweh and his asherah.&rsquo; Thus, claims of &lsquo;practical monotheism,&rsquo; &lsquo;de facto monotheism,&rsquo; &lsquo;virtual monotheism,&rsquo; or even &lsquo;monolatry&rsquo; overlook the biblical evidence to the contrary, retrojecting onto &lsquo;biblical Israel&rsquo; a singularity of divinity that the Bible itself does not claim for ancient Israel. &hellip; the Bible as a whole simply does not teach the existence of only one God.&raquo;</p>

        <p>&laquo;This book is a history of <strong>religious life in the Ancient Near East, from the beginnings of agriculture to Alexander the Great’s invasion in the 300s BCE</strong>. Daniel C. Snell traces key developments in the history, daily life, and religious beliefs of the people of Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, and Iran. His research investigates the influence of those ideas on the West, with particular emphasis on how religious ideas from this historical and cultural milieu continue to influence the way modern cultures and religions view the world. 
Designed to be accessible to students and readers with no prior knowledge of the period, this book uses fictional vignettes to add interest to its material, which is based on careful study of archaeological remains and preserved texts. This book provides a thoughtful summary of the Ancient Near East and includes a comprehensive bibliography to guide readers in further studies of related topics&raquo; (book presentation).</p>
<p>The book develops through 17 chapters investigating religious beliefs on ancient <strong>Near East</strong>, from Egypt to Iran, with an overview on later periods (Greece, Etruria, and Rome).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 1</em> defines the chronological and geographical framework of the book, better also explaining the term ‘Near East’ in the history of the studies on this quite wide area.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em> investigates the ‘early inklings’ of the development of a religious thought in the area, starting from the Neolithic site of <a href="http://www.catalhoyuk.com/"><strong>Çatalhöyük</strong></a>, in Konya Plain (Anatolia) (cf. entry: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hodder2010Emergence">Hodder 2010 Emergence</a>; <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Mellaart1967Catal">Mellaart 1967 Catal</a>), moving to Bronze-Age Mesopotamia, describing some glimpses on Sumerian and Akkadian religion.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 3</em> aims to better define the meaning of the term ‘gods’ under a Near Eastern perspective, explaining their conception and purposes in human life, and the different kinds (or ‘hierarchy’) of gods, (polyad gods, personal gods, and demons).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em> describes the relationship between cities, States, and gods, investigating how gods acted several times in helping the power to amalgamate cities and to forge empires, with a focus on Ur III piety and temple-centred administration, on later Old Babylonian decentralization, until reaching also the Hittite empire.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em> is entirely focused on <strong>Egypt</strong> (between 4000 and 1400 BC), displaying the birth of religious thoughts, art, and architecture, mostly as a manifestation of the pharaonic power and sovereignty on the entire world (the pharaoh being an actual god on earth).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 6</em> discusses about the many gods of Egypt and the Egyptian polytheism in general.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 7</em> moves to analyse the <strong>Amarna period</strong> (ca. 1350-1300 BC and the establishment by Akhenaten of the first ‘monotheism’ (or maybe better ‘henotheism’).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 8</em> presents religious practices in Egypt, mostly focusing of the embalming rituals and the afterlife beliefs and defence against evils (both in life and afterlife).     </p>
<p><em>Chapter 9</em> focuses on the so-called <strong>‘International Age’</strong> (ca. 1400-1000 BC), when the contacts between the different entities of ancient Near East strongly interacted with Egypt and the Mediterranean world in general; the author devotes a paragraph to the <strong>Epic of Gilgamesh</strong>, which spread from Ur III period onwards;</p>
<p><em>Chapter 10</em> describes the relationship between gods and people, under the different forms of enquiry on personal <strong>fate</strong> (Sumerian <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0035289">NAM.TAR</a>; Akkadian šimtu), <strong>divine decrees</strong>, <strong>divination</strong>, and <strong>exorcism</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 11</em> discloses the development of <strong>monotheism</strong> in <strong>Israel</strong>, connecting the Israelite religion to Egypt and Babylon.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 12</em> investigates the later religious changes during the so-called <strong>‘Axial Age’</strong> (ca. 8<sup>th</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> cent. BC), showing how religion thoughts slightly changed during this period in many geographical areas, from the Mediterranean (with Greek Pre-Socratics and Platonism) to China (with Confucius and Lao-Tze), India (with Buddha), and Iran (with Zoroaster); the author further stresses how the Syro-Mesopotamian area was not affected by these changes in mind, developing on the other side a reflection about the problem of the individual, revitalizing and spreading texts about the topic of the <strong>righteous suffering</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 13</em> insists on the topic of the difference between <strong>good gods</strong> and <strong>bad gods</strong>, as it developed in Zoroastrian religion, later affecting also the dualistic idea (sometimes labelled as heretical) of <strong>good</strong> and <strong>evil</strong> in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 14</em> moves to <strong>Syria-Palestine</strong>, focusing on the cult of Baal.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 15</em> investigates the various influences of ancient Near Easter religion on <strong>Greece</strong>, <strong>Etruria</strong>, and <strong>Rome</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 16</em> treats the topic of the <strong>influence</strong> of ancient Near Eastern religious thought on modern religions.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 17</em> tries to reconstruct the actual experience of <strong>religious practices</strong> in ancient Near Eastern religion, linking textual and archaeological evidence concluding that &laquo;we cannot really experience Ancient Near Eastern religion. We can at most imagine. But we should&raquo; (p. 207).</p>
<p>[The volume describes different religions of the antiquity, from the Mediterranean to China, starting from the beginning of the history in the fourth millennium BC, reaching the classic time. The comparative approach presented in this volume is noteworthy because the author tries to identify the influence that Near Eastern religions had on modern religious systems.] </p>

        <p>In the opening paragraphs of this article, the author provides a detailed overview of previous scholarship in history of religions and Assyriology devoted to the understanding of the ultimate social and cultural purpose of the Akitu festival. Sommer focuses in particular on the works published by the historian of religion J. Z. Smith, who suggested that the festival functioned as a piece of national-religious propaganda.</p>
<p>Sommer suggests that, through a careful reading of the ritual instructions for the Akitu festival, it is possible to identify a cosmogonic function according to which the Esagila temple, and hence the world, were symbolically razed, purified, and re-created. At the same time kingship, and hence cosmic order, were symbolically abolished and renewed. Sommer provides written evidence in support of his idea that the Akitu festival restored order by temporarily undermining it stems - by analyzing different phases of the ritual, the symbolism of fire and water, the so-called &ldquo;negative confession&rdquo; pronounced by the king and the prayers recited by priests and singers. «The nexus between Esagila’s (re)building and the world’s creation must have been particularly clear to the ritual’s participants, who were well aware that Esagila had originally been built by the gods as capstone of the universe. After all, only one day earlier, at the outset of the festival, <em>Enuma Elish</em> had been recited. The relevance of this poem to the Akitu festival lies especially in the nature of the creation it depicts.» (p. 89).</p>

        <p>«This book offers <strong>a study of the calendars of ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome, Gaul, and all other parts of the Mediterranean and the Near East, from the origins up to and including Jewish and Christian calendars in late Antiquity</strong>. Particular attention is given to the structure of calendars and their political context. Most ancient calendars were set and controlled by political rulers; they served as expressions of political power, as mechanisms of social control, and sometimes, on the contrary, as assertions of political independence and dissidence. Ancient calendars were very diverse, but they all shared a common history, evolving on the whole from flexible, lunar calendars to fixed, solar schemes. The Egyptian calendar played an important role in this process, most notably inspiring the institution of the Julian calendar in Rome, the forerunner of our modern Gregorian calendar. In this book it is argued that the rise of fixed calendars was not the result of scientific or technical progress, but of major political and social changes that transformed the ancient world under the great Near Eastern, Hellenistic, and Roman Empires. <strong>The institution of standard, fixed calendars served the administrative needs of these extensive empires, but also contributed to their cultural and political cohesion</strong>. This ultimately led, conversely, to late antique perceptions of calendar diversity as an expression of heresy and cause of social schism.» (Author&rsquo;s abstract)</p>

        <p>&laquo;From antiquity, individuals, tribes, and cultures have sought the abilities of singular individuals to try to heal them or to help them to endure the onslaughts of disease. For thousands of years before recorded history, these services were provided by the <strong>medicine man or shaman</strong> of the tribe, whose secret treatments were passed from generation to generation by the apprenticeship methods of teaching. For the most part, their therapies were at best palliative and their effects were placebo and psychological in nature&raquo; (from authors’ abstract on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2129621/">publisher’s webpage</a>).</p>

        <p>&laquo;Each society that relies on divination curates an ensemble of means and personnel that comprise a <strong>divinatory economy</strong>. Dreams represent a peculiar means of acquiring divined knowledge in the divinatory economy of the ancient Near East. They may be uninduced phenomena; or they may be induced. They can never be easily credited, for they are not witnessed by any other person than the dreamer. Yet everyone dreams and so can conceive of the dreaming experience of others. And because everyone dreams, each member of the culture stands in a potentially divinatory relationship with his or her society. In this study, I attempt to delineate the political location of divinatory dreams and dreaming in ancient Mesopotamia and Syria-Palestine. First, I discuss the special problems that dreams raise for people in a dream-sharing society. Then, eliciting evidence from documents and literary texts of Mesopotamia, I outline the constructive functions of divinatory dreams and dreaming and the attempts by the divinatory economy to manage the effects of dreams. After having established the parameters with the Mesopotamian evidence, I turn to the biblical literature to ascertain the political location of dreams in the biblical literature&raquo; (author’s abstract).</p>

        <p>The article delineates the goals and gains of Assyria in the West prior to the time of Tiglath-pileser III, and examines the impact of the West on the culture of Assyria in the eighth and early seventh centuries BCE. The brief examination of <strong>religious ritual</strong> is most pertinant to the themes of our work. Tadmor mentions that under Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, there were court prophets who addressed the king in an &laquo;almost biblical fashion, unattested before in Mesopotamia.&raquo; (p. 43). He is unsure of the origin of this practice: &laquo;<strong>prophecy in Assyria</strong> of the seventh century is not necessarily a newly acquired Aramaic or Israelite institution. Perhaps it was an Assyrian, as versus a Babylonian, phenomenon, which Assyria shared with the West from the Amorite age.&raquo; (p. 43) Western influence can also be discerned in the <strong>specifically Mesopotamian practice of liver oracles</strong>. </p>

        <p>This long and detailed article proposes to investigate the topics of <strong>servility and servile systems in Babylonia</strong> as an aggregate phenomenon, to be analyzse on a large scale with both quantitative and qualitative methods. At first, it offers an overview of previous Assyriological studies and theories that had been applied to study the servile people of Mesopotamia, and then it highlights the additional hurdles encountered by those who aim to study servile population on the basis of Babylonia’s written record (issues connected to translation, identification, documentary continuity, and historical characterization). Ultimately, Tenney comes to the conclusion that «the origins of servile systems in Babylonia can be explained with the Nieboer-Domar hypothesis, which proposes that large-scale systems of bondage will arise in regions with plentiful land but few workers. Once established, these systems persisted and were reinforced through Babylonia’s high balance mortality, political ideologies, economic incentives, and social structures.» (pp. 715-716).
In §11 (esp at pp. 762-763), Tenney investigates in particular the concept of <strong><em>dullum</em></strong>, to demonstrate that servility in all of its manifestations was embraced and codified by the monarch or those writing on his behalf. He quotes examples taken from the literary poems of <em>Atrahasis</em>, <em>Enuma Eliš</em>, and <em>The Toil of Babylon</em>, in which it is stated that the roles of mankind are to
perform the work of the state and provide for the gods. The term <em>dullum</em> that appears in these texts is translated as “forced labor” or “corvée”, to encompass a range of meanings. «In Atrahasis, <em>dullu</em> describes the tasks that the inferior Igigi gods were forced to perform for the seven Anunnaki gods, and the fulfillment of these obligations was transferred to mankind after their creation. By extension, one could argue that because these texts were allegories for an ideal Babylonia, the imposition of work on the less powerful was explicitly known to maintain the position of elites, whether they be gods or men.» (p. 763).</p>

        <p>This volume describes, through 14 chapters, important archaeological discoveries in the <strong>Shanidar Cave</strong>, located in the Erbil Governorate, in north-eastern Iraq, within the Zagros mountains. Here, archaeologists and anthropologists of the Columbia University, and later of the Washington University, uncovered graves of eight adult and two infant <strong>Neanderthals</strong> (ca. 65000-35000 BP), together with two late proto-Neolithic (ca. 10600 BP) cemeteries containing remains of about 35 individuals. </p>
<p>Some of this graves shows relevant evidence of <strong>burial practices</strong> (such as the so-called <em>Shanidar 4</em>, known as the ‘flower burial’) and other clues pointing to people taking care of their aged members of the community, such as the case of <em>Shanidar 1</em>, the skeleton (later named ‘Nandy’ by the archaeologists) of a male between 35 and 45 years, presenting traces of proto-surgical operations, probably indicating that this ancient Neanderthal community took care of its elder people (a good comparison to the Dmanisi&rsquo;s <em>Skull G</em> discovered in Georgia (here a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560hiKxz-eg">brief introductive video</a>), belonging to an aged man with no teeth, well described in <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm">Buccellati and Kelly Buccellati 2014</a>, on <a href="http://urkesh.org/attach/GBDalProfondo.pdf#page=24">pp. 23-24</a>).</p>
<p>[The book involves the emergence of first religious beliefs and cultic, specifically burial, customs in a very early prehistoric period, underlining how already before the <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, the Neanderthals have already developed a kind of prototypic <strong>‘religious (or at least spiritual) thought’</strong>, showing respect for elder members of the group and even <strong>‘piety’</strong> towards their dead. A virtual and interactive tour of Shanidar Cave is possible thanks to a 3D scanning and rendering realised by <a href="https://app.iconem.com/#/3d/project/public/3682c9b9-b5c1-459d-b3f2-ea956eb3fa4f/scene/1de792c0-15fc-4423-8a3d-efeabb3cec56">ICONEM</a>.&gt;]</p>

        <p>Ulanowski opens his article with a definition of divination, i.e., &laquo;human observation of signs perceived to be divine and our response to them&raquo; (p. 14). Divination in ancient Mesopotamia was based on the idea that the future was pre-determined - and yet, men could receive some indications on the future by the gods, mostly via omens and portents which could be observed and/or elicited. Thus, the author infers that the future was conceived not solely as a creation of the gods, but as the result of an interaction between men and gods.</p>
<p>The author traces a useful (though brief) history of divination in Mesopotamia, from the Sumerian texts of the third millennium BCE to the first millennium. The author considers divination indeed as a form of ritual (i.e. a formal procedure carried out by trained practitioners in order to provide clients with answers) but also as &lsquo;pure performance&rsquo;. He analyzes the roles played by the several deities involved in the divinatory practices (Shamash, Adad, Sin, Ninsianna and Ea).</p>
<p>Finally, Ulanowski highlights the performatice act inherent in the very act of the interpretation of signs - hence the stress which placed in the ancient written sources with regards to the skill of the professionals and the secrecy in the transmission of texts connected to their professions.</p>

        <p>The author&rsquo;s stated goal for this book is to investigate Israelite and Mesopotamian penitential prayer (called <em>šig?</em> and <em>dingiršadibba</em>). In doing this, however, van der Toorn undertakes an investigation of the moral world-view of each culture in which the prayers were recited, using a comparative approach between Israel and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>In the opening chapter, the scholar provides a broad comparison of the social organization, religious beliefs, and intellectual orientation of the two cultures under investigation, including an introduction on the methodology that he intends to apply and a reflection on the comparative approach itself. Then, he begins his analysis of Israelite and Mesopotamian moral concepts - dividing them into two categories: ethical rules (which refers to the opposition right/wrong) and etiquette (related, instead to proper/improper). van der Toorn however acknowledges that both these categories aim to win the divine favor and remove any possibility of anger and punishment from the god(s).</p>
<p>Following his investigation, the scholar analyzes the concepts of taboo, oath, and curse - always pointing out to similarities and differences between the Biblical and Mesopotamian traditions. Then, he goes on by analyzing the human experience of divine punishment through a variety of written sources (wisdom texts, penitential prayers, medical diagnoses). Overall, van der Toon identifies several major similarities and but a few differences between Israel and Mesopotamia. The main differences which he finds amongst the two is related to the sharp antithesis between &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;fool&rdquo;, &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; and &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; etc. that he detects frequently in the Hebrew Bible, but not so much in Mesopotamian written sources. His explanation is that such antithesis, originated in the ethos of the Israelite aristocracy, remained in use, with certain changes, even after the aristocracy had been weakened, because it suited well the exclusivistic demands of Israelite religion.</p>

        <p>This article aims to analyze the literary passages mentioning the measurement of time and the calendars, as well as to highlight the role of the Mesopotamian gods in carrying out this task. It also provides a synthesis on the units of time and on calendars in the ancient Near East.
Starting from the well-known passages of <em>Enuma Elish</em> in which Marduk fixes the stars and consequently the calendar (see <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-Rel/temi/time.htm">here</a>), the author highlights how another god had been previously involved in the measurement of time, according to the Sumerian literary texts. Indeed, according to <em>Enki and the World Order</em> it is Enki who was in charge of &ldquo;Counting the days and putting the months in their houses, so as to complete the years and to submit the completed years to the assembly for a decision, taking decisions to regularise the days&rdquo;. Another goddess involved in the determination of time was Nisaba: in her role as goddess of cereals, calculation and writing, she embodied the link between agriculture, calculation and observation of the sky. According to the poem <em>Lugal-e</em>, it is for Nisaba that the days are counted according to the phases of the moon (l. 721). Verderame, then, investigates the astronomical role and the relationship between the moon Nanna/Sin and the sun Utu/Damash, according to three literary compositions: <em>Enuma Elish</em> V, 15-22; <em>The Exaltation of Inanna/Ishtar</em> III, 47-60; and a liturgical composition dedicated to Nanna 58-60.
The last part of the article deals with a general synthesis on the measurement of time in Mesopotamia - in particular, with the units of time associated with physical phenomena perceptible by men: the day with its different parts (such as evening, night and dawn), the month, the year and the seasons. In one final paragraph, Verderame provides the readers with a useful list of the most relevant publications on calendars in ancient Mesopotamia, grouped according to a chronological and geographical criterion.</p>

        <p>The aim Vidal&rsquo;s article is to review recent academic contributions on the issue of royal divinization in ancient Mesopotamia and to assess the real meaning of &ldquo;royal divinization&rdquo; in the different Mesopotamian societies in which such phenomenon is witnessed. Vidal then analyzes instances of royal divinization across time, spanning from the Early-Dinastic kings to the specific case of Naram-Sin, from the kings of Ur III to those of the Isin-Larsa and Old-Babylonian periods.</p>
<p>According to the author, such diachronic review shows how, in Mesopotamia, the political power ultimately resorted to theological speculation in order to try to solve immediate problems and ideological challenges. In the specific case of Naram-Sin, Vidal identifies the reasons for his divinization in the lack of a patron deity for the recently-founded capital city of Akkad, which made it incapable of competing on the religious plan with cities of long tradition such as Ur, Uruk or Nippur. During the Third Dinasty of Ur, under the government of Ur-Nammu and his successors, Mesopotamia became a strongly centralized country whose territories were subordinate to a new state with capital in Ur. However, from a religious point of view, Ur could not claim the theological legitimacy that other cities whose existence was attributed to divine foundation could instead claim. Thus, the kings of Ur opted for their own divinization so as to endowing the state with a religious legitimacy that would consolidate its position: the state led by Ur also had a patron god, and he was the king.</p>
<p>Finally, after the disappearance of the Ur III empire, different cities disputed its inheritance and used the same ideological tools to justify their claims. Thus, the city of Isin promoted a new version of the well-known Sumerian Royal List - in which Isin was depicted as a continuator of the political hegemony of Ur. Likewise, the kings of Isin itself (and some kings of Larsa and Ešnunna) saw in the phenomenon of royal divinization a further resource to present themselves as direct and legitimate continuators of the divinized kings of Ur.</p>

The first ritual presents four key-elements, already investigated in <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Bonechi1989Ebla">Bonechi 1989 Ebla</a>:</p>
<p>1) the presence of a ‘purification priest’ [<em>contra</em> Viganò, interpreting this term as referring not to the priest but to the ritual itself], called A:NAGA = a:tu<sub>5</sub>;</p>
<p>2) the offering to the god <sup>d</sup>KU-<em>ra</em>;</p>
<p>3) its association with dug<sub>4</sub>-ga <em>i-sa-rí</em>, probably offerings of garments and wool;</p>
<p>4) the spelling of <em>da-mi-mu</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Regular Offerings</em>-ritual is then discussed, starting with the different spelling of the term (cf. entry: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Bonechi1989Ebla">Bonechi 1989 Ebla</a>): ‘KA.DI-2 = sá.dug<sub>4</sub>-2’, ‘KA-GÁ-2’, and ‘dug<sub>4</sub>-ga’, always appearing with the same gloss ‘<em>i-sa-rí / i-sa-i</em>’, i.e. ‘regular’. From the first of these terms, ‘KA.DI-2 = sá.dug<sub>4</sub>-2’, it derived the regular form ‘sá.dug<sub>4</sub>-ga’ (attested on L. 2712), glossed ‘<em>zi-gi-nu</em>’ in other texts and interpreted by Milano (<a href="https://www.arborsapientiae.com/libro/1710/testi-amministrativi-assegnazioni-di-prodotti-alimentari-archivio-l-2712-parte-1-archivi-reali-di-ebla-testi-ix--lucio-milano.html"><em>ARET</em> 9</a>, p. 402) as deriving from the Semitic <em>škn</em>, ‘to provide’ (<em>et al.</em>).</p>
<p>[The author discusses in this paper the actual realisation of religious practices at <a href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html">Ebla</a>, analysing the textual sources with a strict philological approach.

        <p>The author investigates the ritual text TM 1730, comparing this document with other <strong>purification rituals</strong>, such as the ‘ì-giš sag ritual’. The following paragraph is devoted to the analysis of the <strong>sikil-ritual</strong>, ‘the purification, cleansing ceremony’, presenting texts from <a href="http://ebda.cnr.it/">Ebla’s Archives</a>.The author specifically underlings the connection between the a:tu<sub>5</sub>-ritual with the crowning of the new king (‘en’) at Ebla. Furthermore, the ‘ì-giš sag-ritual’ concerns the use of <strong>oil</strong> (ì-giš), during the ritual action of the anointment of the new enthroned king; the author reports some instances of the anointment riual: sometimes, a similar ritual was also applied to <strong>funerary ceremonies</strong>. In the end, the author presents ‘cleansing ceremonies’ practised at Ebla, called in Akkadian ‘sikil’-ritual(s).</p>
<p>To conclude: &laquo;‘The anointing of the head’ (ì-giš sag ritual) is not restricted to use in a funerary ceremony. Such a practice is performed for weddings and other occasions in which oil does not play the role of a cleansing element but is part of a ceremony of joy and celebration. Finally, the ‘purification’ (sikil) is performed in cases of <strong>illness</strong> that sometimes ended in death&raquo; (p. 22). </p>

        <p>In ancient Egypt, skin diseases were understood as divine punishment. The author first establishes the <strong>origin myth of disease</strong> as Re&rsquo;s punishment of seditious humanity: in order to prevent outbreaks of human pride, the god invents sickness, epidemics and death.</p>
<p>There is a close relationship between skin diseases and other important features of Egyptian culture. Some skin diseases leave visible signs on the skin and disqualify from temple worship. Volokhine establishes a connection between the mythological explanation of a priestly garment (a panther skin) and the &ldquo;signing&rdquo; of Seth&rsquo;s skin by Anubis. He also points out the &ldquo;signing&rdquo; of prisoners of war by government scribes, which indicated the new slave&rsquo;s belonging to another: a loss of identity. Thus the <strong>&ldquo;stigmata&rdquo; typical of skin diseases, in the Egyptian conception, refers to a divine &ldquo;signing&rdquo;</strong> of the sick person.</p>
<p>Volokhine proposes to examine this mythological horizon and system of classification in an upcoming work.</p>

        <p><em>Chapter 12</em> of this important introduction on ancient Near Eastern studies is entirely devoted to the presentation of <strong>religion</strong> and <strong>magic</strong> in ancient Mesopotamian world.</p>
<p>Several issues are discussed:</p>
<p>1) a strict connection of <strong>religion</strong> and <strong>magic</strong>, two spheres interacting each other; <strong>magic</strong> is divided into ‘white’ and ‘black’ magic;
2) <strong>demons</strong> (both good and evil), <strong>evil entities</strong> (sometimes unburied people), and <strong>ritual spells</strong> aiming at chasing away the action of any evil entity; 
3) the perception of religion of <strong>common people</strong>: since we know religion through written sources, elaborated by a restricted group of scribes, the way common people conceived religion is of difficult access <small>[this opinion is also shared in Schmökel, Hartmut 1959, <em>I Sumeri</em>, Firenze: Sansoni, p. 174, about the construction of temples: &laquo;We cannot know what the peasant thought when a bureaucratic order repeatedly stole him from his plow, imposing an exhausting job under heated sun for the construction of imponent buildings dedicated to worship&raquo;; English translation by mDP];</small> 
4) the <strong>list of gods</strong>: the number of gods increased during time, being subjected also to later Semitic <strong>syncretism</strong>; 
5) Babylonian <strong>faith</strong> and <strong>theology</strong>: &laquo;The tendency to become familiar with the Sumerian tradition was certainly constant, but a part of it, including many mythical elements of different origin on the struggles between gods, remained extraneous. They [i.e. the Babylonians] were looking for gods who combined the commitment to the conservation of the creation order with the assistance to individuals&raquo; (p. 195; English translation by mDP). 
6) <strong>faith</strong> in Assyria: the Assyrians worshipped many Babylonian gods, but sometimes perceived them in a different way; they focused their cults on <strong>Ashur</strong>, the god entrusted to protect the king.
7) <strong>sin</strong>, <strong>ethic</strong>, <strong>theodicy</strong>, and <strong>afterlife</strong>: the Sumerians and the Babylonians perceived the strength of <strong>fate</strong> and interpreted <strong>sins</strong> as an offence toward gods, a fault to be amended by specific rituals. 
8) the <strong>afterlife</strong>: we do not have a clear description of the Netherworld: it seems to be a gloomy place, where there is no distinction between faithful and sinful people (only in the Babylonian period a possible reward for good people was envisaged, along with the punishment of sinners); <br>
9) <strong>Sumerian cultic activities</strong>, <strong>sacrifices</strong>, <strong>priests</strong>, and <strong>prophets</strong>: the author stresses the importance of the <strong>sacred marriage</strong>, a festival based on mythological accounts about Dumuzi, celebrated to guarantee fertility in all the livings; 
10) Babylonian <strong>cultic activities</strong>: many rituals taken from the Sumerians, adding new cultic activities; the most important was the New Year festival, the <a href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8381"><em>akītu</em></a>; 
11) <strong>Assyrian cults</strong>: the author focuses on the <strong>substitutive sacrifices</strong> and the rite of the <strong>substitutive king</strong>. 
12) <strong>Purification</strong> in cultic and magic was considered as a way to remove any external impurity from a person or a sacred objects, such as the cultic statues on which the <strong>washing of the mouth</strong> (<em>mīš pî</em>) and the <strong>opening of the mouth</strong> (<em>pīt pî</em>) rituals were performed (see <a href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#9681">RlA</a>);
13) <strong>death</strong> was strictly connected to <strong>fate</strong>, remarking how graveless people were condemned to wander eternally in the air as spirits, without any rest; <strong>funerary practices</strong> (diversifies from place to place) consisted of lamentations, funerary processions, and burials in the ground (with or without grave goods).     </p>
<p>[Note specifically the discussion on the meaning of <strong>religion</strong> and <strong>magic</strong> in ancient Mesopotamian mind, defining these concepts as two specific spheres (exemplified by texts of different ‘genre’) strictly connected and interacting each other.]</p>

        <p>Watt&rsquo;s article is founded on one main assumption: «Ritual rhetoric &hellip; pervaded royal propaganda, as well as temple texts. It also provided the principal rationale for criticizing the <em>status quo</em>.» (p. 39). The author follows Aristotle and Kenneth Burke in defining rhetoric in terms of &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo;, because he believes that such definition allows a modern reader to identify one of the main features of ancient Near Eastern texts - i.e. the intention to mandate and/or prohibit certain behaviors on the part of the readers or hearers. Wyatt also analyzes the category &ldquo;ritual&rdquo; - which he defines as «a modern heuristic device for distinguishing and describing certain kinds of human behavior.» (p. 40) providing in particular definitions for &ldquo;ritual texts&rdquo; (i.e. «texts that describe or prescribe rituals») and &ldquo;ritual rhetoric&rdquo; («a wider range of statements that invoke either ritual behavior itself or the institutions that sponsor ritual behavior (temples, priesthoods, etc.) for persuasive purposes.», p. 40).</p>
<p>Watts attributes to ritual rhetoric a significant role in ancient Mesopotamian society: indeed, he maintains that it provided an ideological basis for political criticism while also serving as a powerful means of persuasion. He sees rhetoric as clearly grounded in the practices of temples and shrines, yet with a far-reaching impact and a power to shape the ideological grounds for political power and resistance. Furthermore, Watts believe that the sudy of ancient ritual rhetoric is able to provide insights into the political and social struggles of the the less documented non-elite people, in their everyday lives.</p>

        <p>By discussing several examples where a ritual has a clear connection to a myth from the ancient Near East, the author aims to emphasize that the connection of myth and ritual varied within different cultures and periods. Additionally, the author highlights how very often myths involved in rituals are different from the myths known from the literary tradition, thus making it difficult for a modern reader to understand the separate functions for the literary tradition and whatever tradition lay behind ritual texts.</p>
<p>Weeks first investigates a group of texts in which he can identify with a good degree of certainty such connection of myth and ritual: the Sumerian Sacred Marriage ceremony; a number of Akkadian incantations; Assyrian Cult Commentaries; Egyptian rituals generally; the Hittite myths of the absent god; the festivals of Passover and Booths in the Hebrew Bible. Then, he discusses two instances which he finds more uncertain and controversial: the Babylonian New Year Festival (with its connection to the <em>Enuma Eliš</em>) and the Hittite <em>purulli</em> festival (and the Myth of Iluyanka).</p>
<p>The Babylonian New Year Festival is discussed at pp. 103-105. Weeks highlights how the fact that <em>Enuma Eliš</em> was recited before the god early in the festival is indeed a ritual description, but nowhere in the texts do we find an explanation for such recitation. Rather than considering the acts performed in the festivals as a re-enactment of the story narrated in the myth, Weeks proposes to see the events narrated in the myth as a justification for the ritual itself. «The conclusion to <em>Enuma Eliš</em>, and therefore arguably the purpose and point of the story, is the building of Marduk’s temple. One might also argue that the proclamation of Marduk as king of the gods is a close second as the climax of the story. It is conceivable therefore that these elements of the story act as the justification of the following ritual. Marduk’s role as the king of the gods, receiving the other deities in his temple for the determining of the fates, is thus justified by the story but there is no necessity that the ritual acts out the story.» (p. 105).</p>

        <p>This book is completely devoted to the presentation of the features and cult of the goddess <strong>Ištar-Šawuška</strong> in <strong>Asia Minor</strong>.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into 11 chapters after an introduction about the textual sources, their dating and the description of the goddess herself. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 1</em>: the Hurrian Šawuška in the Mesopotamian tradition. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em>: the role of the goddess’s cults during the Hittite Empire (after 1370 BC).</p>
<p><em>Chapter 3</em>: appearance and nature of the goddess. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em>: her position into the <strong>pantheon</strong> and <strong>myths</strong> related to her. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em>: <strong>cult-inventory texts</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 6</em>: <strong>cult-calendars</strong> and <strong>festivals</strong> for the goddess. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 7</em>: offering and ritual for the goddess. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 8</em>: cult of the goddess. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 9</em>: priests and <strong>cultic personnel</strong> of the goddess. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 10</em>: diffusion of the goddess’s cult and her <strong>devotional places</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 11</em>: the reverberation of the goddess’s cult to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[Particularly interesting is the reference to the cult of this goddess at <a href="http://urkesh.org/"><strong>Urkesh/Tell Mozan</strong></a>, since her cult in this ancient North-Syrian city could be one of the earliest attested, so far.]          </p>

        <p>The goal of this paper is to investigate the figure of Tamar in Genesis 38 in the light of what is known about sacred prostitution in ancient Mesopotamia, by means of a careful analysis of original sources as well as a comparison between Hebrew, Sumerian and Akkadian terms. Indeed, Goodnick Westenholz detects a confusion on the translation of the terms through which Tamar is defined in the Hebrew Bible already in the early work of the biblicists of the Greek period. She thus proposes to evaluate the prebiblical and contemporary records of the ancient Near East, for the light that these may shed on the problem.</p>
<p>Firstly, the scholar analyzes «the nearest neighbors to Canaans not only geographically but also culturally, ethnically, and temporally» (p. 249) i.e. North Syria and, in particular, the Ugaritic society. Here, as in the Bible, both male and female <em>qdšm</em> are attested - though the attestations are admittedly scanty. However, Goodnick Westenholz&rsquo;s conclusion is that «<em>qdš</em> in the North Syrian culture area referred to a group of people connected with the temple and its cult whose status was inheritable. From the Ugaritic evidence, we speculated that they might perform levitical functions.» (p. 250).</p>
<p>Then, the scholar provides the readers with a thorough chronological and lexical analysis of the attestations for the root <em>qdš</em> in the Mesopotamian sources, which mostly appears in the noun form in the feminine <em>qadištu</em>/<em>qaššatu</em>/<em>qašdatu</em>, to indicate a woman of special status. Unlike the west, there is no trace of a corresponding male noun <em>qadšu</em>. Goodnick Westenholz finds the most significant Mesopotamian reference in relation to the Tamar story in a compendium of legal terminology used in the training of scribes and notaries, one example of which is quoted at p. 251.</p>
<p>In the final pages of this article, the author ultimately denies that the phaenomenon of sacred prostitutes ever existed in ancient Mesopotamia, providing methodological, historical and philological evidence in support of her statement.</p>

        <p>Whatham&rsquo;s study, written over 100 years ago, asserts that &ldquo;<strong>the Israelites, when taken in hand by Moses, were polytheists</strong>, a belief, moreover, which was only finally eradicated through the teaching of the prophets, and the bitter experience of the captivity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He examines a few scriptural passages that point to <strong>a form of polytheism or tribal henotheism at the origins of Israel</strong>, such as God&rsquo;s self-revelation to Moses in Ex 6:3, Jacob&rsquo;s treatment of his wives&rsquo; gods in Gen 35:4, and the fact that Moses commands the people to worship YHWH because he is a &ldquo;jealous god&rdquo;&ndash;not because he is the only god. It was the prophets who radicalized henotheism into exclusive monotheism, in Whatham&rsquo;s estimation. </p>
<p>Whatham notes some inconsistencies regarding the forbidding of images, especially the episode regarding the bronze serpent in Num 21, and concludes that Moses&rsquo; command regarded only images of foreign gods. Thus, &ldquo;Israel did not conceive Jehovah to be the sole God; in fact, as I have shown, they viewed him merely as one among other gods, though as a rule the greatest of all gods. Indeed, until the advent of the later prophets, Israel&rsquo;s teachers had so instructed them.&rdquo; </p>

        <p>&laquo;It will be argued that the cuneiform writing system, the Sumerian and Akkadian lexicon, and the
place names of Southern Mesopotamia preserve traces of an early Indo-European language, indeed the earliest by more than a millennium. Furthermore, this evidence is detailed and consistent enough to reconstruct a number of features of the proposed Indo-European language, <strong>Euphratic</strong>, and to sketch an outline of Euphratean cultural patterns&raquo; (author’s abstract on p. 156).</p>
<p>[The existence of an alleged Euphratic linguistic phase, suggested by some scholars as an antecedent of Sumerian in Southern Mesopotamia, is still quite debated.

        <p>The starting point of this article is the basic assumption that Mesopotamian diviners confidently practiced their queries in the strong belief that the divine&rsquo;s manifestation would have taken place via one of the various divinatory channels: the divine presence, thus, would have been &lsquo;embodied&rsquo; in the examined media, in the form of some sort of sign. Winitzer, however, also notes how looking at the omen collections from ancient Mesopotamia the mentioning of deities is almost absent.</p>
<p>He thus analyzes such apparent discrepancy, at first by discussing the conceptual setup of Mesopotamian divinization and then by considering in particular the practice of lecanomancy (i.e. the divinatory method which studies the configuration of oil poured in water). He maintains that in ancient Mesopotamia the entire extispicy event parallels the idea of revelation and transmission of the divine word from the god(s) to a selected group of people. Thus, if one accepts the premise that Mesopotamian diviners could indeed identify signs sent by the god(s) via extispicy, then logically it follows that divination was a source of revelation in itself.</p>
<p>In the lecanomancy practice, in particular, the divinatory corpus contained a considerable number of individual entries which aimed at asking about the &ldquo;presence&rdquo; of particular deities. Winitzer, thus, asks: &laquo;How to interpret apodoses professing a particular god&rsquo;s &ldquo;presence&rdquo;? Can one justly speak of these as conveying an early sort of what later theological reflection might label an epiphany?&raquo; (p. 185)</p>
<p>In the end, Winitzer confirms that the reality of the presence (or absence) of a given sign was equated with the theological metaphor of divine presence or abandonment.</p>

This symposium was initiated and organized by the students and scholars of the post-graduate school ‘Symbols of the Dead’. The topic of the symposium was to evaluate the possibilities in reconstructing Ancient Near Eastern <strong>funerary rituals</strong> from available archaeological and textual evidence. </p>
<p>Contributors from seven countries discussed many aspects of ritual behaviour linked to death, the <strong>after-life</strong> and the variations in ritual treatment of the deceased before, during and after the actual burial. </p>
<p>Among the many issues raised were questions related to the kinds of rituals linked to death in different cultural surroundings, the intentions of the actors conducting such rituals, their meaning and social importance, the question of <strong>ancestors</strong> and <strong>grave goods</strong>, and of grave offerings, the reasons for and the meaning of different burial types, and the theoretical and methodological approaches to ritual. </p>
<p>Archaeological case studies were introduced, available textual evidence was presented, and even an ethnographic perspective from Kyrgyzstan is contributed. The archaeological and philological sources presented come from a wide geographical framework including Syria and Northern Mesopotamia, the Syro-Anatolian regions, the Southern Levant, Egypt, and Iran. Their chronological frame spans from the third to the first millennium BC. These contributions will enrich our understanding of the various cultural approaches to death in the Ancient Near East and increase our insight into many aspects of <strong>funerary rituals</strong>&raquo; (abstract on <a href="https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_1969.ahtml?NKLN=86_B">Harrassowitz webpage</a>).</p>
<p>[The contribution is relevant for its approach in the analysis and interpretation of ancient burial customs in ancient Near East and Egypt: starting from archaeological evidence as the ground floor, the author reconstructs the meaning of funerary rituals, grave goods, and ancestor cults on the base of a comparative approach involving ethno-anthropological comparisons.]</p>

        <p>This volume is intended as a compilation of texts for students, for a course entitled &ldquo;Space and Time in World Religions&rdquo; which aimed at cover the cultures of the ancient Near East, India and Africa, Islam and Christianity. The book deriving from this class attempts a thematic and selective (though no complete) coverage of the ancient Near Eastern religion (Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Ugaritic, Hittite, Israelite). The main purpose of the author is to illustrate how ancient Near Eastern peoples employed metaphors derived from human experience to conceptualize time and space.</p>
<p>As for space, the volume discusses both cosmogony (myths of creation and destruction) and cosmology (the cosmic ocean, the central mountain). With regard to time, its reckoning (calendars), foundation myths, eschatology, and periodization are analyzed. The book also includes a few examples taken from Greek and Latin authors, for comparative purposes, and it extends to cover Second Temple Jewish and early Christian sources.</p>

        <p>This miscellanea collects 9 contributions all related to the topic of the <strong>death or disappearing of a god</strong> in ancient Mediterranean cultures.</p>
<p>After a <em>preface</em> by <a href="https://pisa.academia.edu/PaoloXella">Paolo Xella</a> presenting the topic of the volume, <em>chapter 1</em> (by many authors) outlines the topic of the <strong>dying god</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 2</em> (by Gabriella Scandone Matthiae) describes the figure of ‘Osiris the African’, implying the royal death. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 3</em> (by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paola-pisi-3528288/?originalSubdomain=it">Paola Pisi</a>) focuses on the divine figure of Dumuzi-Tammuz. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 4</em> (by <a href="https://www.anatolistica.unifi.it/vp-167-anna-maria-polvani.html">Anna Maria Polvani</a>) deals with the god Telipinu. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 5</em> (by <a href="https://pisa.academia.edu/PaoloXella">Paolo Xella</a>) relates with Baal of Ugarit and other Phoenician gods. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 6</em> (by <a href="http://www.icvbc.cnr.it/Ribichini.pdf">Sergio Ribichini</a>) presents the topic of the disappearance of Adonis. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 7</em> (by <a href="https://www.liceo-orazio.edu.it/public/Il_Liceo/Organizzazione/CV_Preside.pdf">Maria Grazia Lancellotti</a>) aims at outlining the figure of Attis. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 8</em> (by <a href="https://unime.academia.edu/GiuliaGasparro">Giulia Sfameni Gasparro</a>) displays the story of Demeter and Kore/Persephone at Eleusis, linking divine absence to <strong>human fate</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Chapter 9</em> (by Maria Rocchi) deals with the death of Dionysus, describing the ‘new harmony of his limbs’. </p>
<p>An <em>afterword</em> (by Ileana Chirassi Colombo) addresses a question (&laquo;Why a God Must Die?&raquo;) and tries to define the religious significance and the cultural meaning of the figure of the ‘dying god’.       </p>
<p>[Death is indeed an evident and ineluctable feature of human life; nevertheless, and even unexpectedly, in many religions of ancient Mediterranean world also gods could die, either because of a physical or a ‘symbolic’ death embedded in the disappearing of the god from the human world or even in the common topic of the divinity leaving his/her specific ‘residential’ city. Since the disappearing of a god, sometimes provoking famine or drought, was perceived in antiquity as a punishment caused by human sins, the analysis of such a phenomenon helps in clarifying how ancient men explained natural events as a consequence of a human mistake or offense towards a specific god.]</p>

        <p>The author deals with a comparison between the religious ideology of <strong>Syria-Palestine</strong> in the Late Bronze Age (as reflected in the Ugaritic evidence) and the <strong>Phoenician</strong> religious tradition of the Iron Age, and focuses in this paper on some peculiar <strong>religious aspects</strong> attested in the documentation of <strong>Ugarit/Ras Shamra</strong>. The paper is introduced by a <em>caveat</em>: in the interpretation of ancient religious practices it is important to avoid a superimposition of modern ideology (stemming from the Judaeo-Christian milieu) on ancient texts produced by cultures &laquo;who did not own or do not even have the term in question: religion&raquo; (p. 525). </p>
<p>A first statement is placed at the beginning of <em>paragraph 2</em>: &laquo;In traditional societies (including those of ancient world), “religious” ideology is simply ideology. The sphere &ndash; conceptual and practical &ndash; which appears to us to be very distinct from the others, resulting from a categorization based on the dichotomy (which is very familiar to us) “sacred” / “profane” represents, on the other hand, in other societies, a total and totalizing dimension, organized according to criteria different from ours&raquo; (p. 526). &laquo;Other cultures thus reveal a <em>Weltanschauung</em> which encompasses not only the cosmogony and the principles of universal order, but also the political, social and economic architecture of the community of men&raquo; (p. 526). It is impossible to detach in ancient world the religious and the socio-political spheres, two realities which strongly merged and interacted. </p>
<p>According to the author, the ancient polytheisms<em> are symbolic system based on a structural complexity and a specific dynamism of interaction: the action of gods was reflected on both a social and individual floor, and its expression is embedded in </em><em>mythology</em><em> and </em><em>cults</em><em>. Each specific god represented an aspect of the cosmic and natural reality and all the gods are systematized into an organic and structured </em><em>pantheon</em>* reflecting the human sphere. </p>
<p>The core contribution is a comparison of the Ugaritic pantheon with those of the Phoenician sites of <strong>Byblos</strong>, <strong>Sidon</strong>, and <strong>Tyre</strong>; furthermore, the author investigates also some morphological aspects of some gods, the origin and diffusion of <strong>‘mythologems’</strong> related to <strong>dead and resurrected gods</strong>, ending with a reflection about the continuity/discontinuity of religious ideology and cultic practices in antiquity.</p>
<p><em>Paragraph 3</em> describes the structure of <strong>Ugaritic pantheon</strong>: <em>sub-paragraph 3.1</em> deals with a short history of the development of the main divine figures at <strong>Ugarit</strong>, structured in an organic system involving specific names, epithets, hierarchical relationships between gods,  genealogies, functions, alliances and antagonisms between gods, filiations, worshipping places (often mythical), gods’ prerogatives and spheres of influence. What seems to be striking in Ugaritic pantheon is the absence of a gods regarded and conceived as stronger than others: nevertheless, two gods can be placed at the top of the Ugaritic pantheon, i.e. the creator god Ilu and the young and strong Baalu, the polyad god at Ugarit (also known as Haddou). After a passage dealing with the different interpretation of Baalu with other gods, the author presents the female figures of Athiratu (Ilu’s consort) and of Anatu, fighting to bring back Baalu’s (her brother) body from the Underworld. <em>Sub-paragraph 3.2</em> focuses on the aforementioned Phoenician cities, pointing out how we cannot relate on primary, textual sources of the 1st millennium BC, but only on later (Greek and Roman) second-hand reports. Giving the fact that each Phoenician city retained a specific pantheon, probably to mark to unique identity of each place, it is impossible to reconstruct a general ‘Phoenician pantheon’. Nevertheless, some common traits can be outlined: the existence of a main god, Baal (also called Adon), and of a main goddess, Baalat. At <strong>Byblos</strong>, a city which got entertained many contacts with Egypt, the polyad goddess was Ashtart, also called ‘Baalat of Byblos’, identified with the Egyptian Hathor and Isis. Baal was also worshipped at Byblos (later called in Classical sources Adonis), and received also some specific epithets, like Baal Shamem (connected to the sky), and Baal Addir (‘Mighty Lord’), a chthonian entity. At <strong>Sidon</strong>, already in the Late Bronze Age, it is attested the god <sup>d</sup>iškur (probably to be assimilated to the Ugaritic Baalu), the <em>Storm god</em>, together with Ashtart; during the Iron Age, the sources mention the couple ‘Baal of Sidon’ and again Ashtart, while the polyad god can be recognized with Eshmun, a warrior deity (elsewhere also an <strong>healing god</strong>, whose name is also attested on a New Kingdom Egyptian medical papyrus, the <em>London Medical Papyrus</em>). At <strong>Tyre</strong>, it is attested a Storm god (in the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC) and the god Melqart, literally ‘the king of the city’, the protector of the town.     </p>

        <p>Yalom affirms that &laquo;We are meaning-seeking creatures. Biologically, our nervous systems are organized in such a way that the brain automatically clusters incoming stimuli into configurations. Meaning also provides a sense of mastery: feeling helpless and confused in the face of random, unpatterned events, we seek to order them and, in so doing, gain a sense of control over them. Even more important, meaning gives birth to values and, hence, to a code of behavior: thus the answer to why questions (Why do I live?) supplies an answer to how questions (How do I live?).&raquo; p. 34</p>

        <p>This book is focused on the <strong>connections between politics, religion, and philosophy in ancient Mesopotamia</strong>: these three spheres were intrinsically entangled, since religion was ‘used’ as a channel of legitimation for the royal power and for the authority of the king as high priest and deputy of the gods on earth (as the case of Neo-Assyrian kingship). Philosophy (i.e. the scribal literary tradition) was the medium allowing this process of legitimation of the king to be affective and understandable, assuring the royal power with a theological (i.e. irrefutable) basis of justification.   </p>

        <p>&laquo;Ever since the first translations and editions of Akkadian prayer texts were published at the end of the 19th century, scholars have noted a number of <strong>parallels between Mesopotamian prayers and the book of Psalms</strong>. The deciphering of these prayer texts coincided with the development of the form-critical method in biblical studies, thus providing significant test cases for comparative genre research of the Psalms. To establish and compare genres of prayer, form-critical studies have addressed the structure of prayers as whole texts. Mesopotamian prayers are typically transmitted as part of a ritual consisting of agenda and the prayer as dicenda, giving rise to hypotheses concerning the primary Sitz im Leben of the biblical psalms. Points of comparison between Akkadian prayers and biblical psalms include the relation between the deity and the praying person, the recurring stock-phrases, and a concluding praise or promise to praise that characterize many psalms of individual lament. Finally, both Mesopotamian and biblical prayers abound in motifs, metaphors, and formulaic language&raquo; (author’s abstract on <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199783335.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199783335-e-002">publisher’s website</a>).</p>
<p>[The contribution is a clear exemplification of the possibility of retracing, also in Mesopotamian literature, compositions to some extent similar to the biblical Psalms.]</p>

        <p>A distinction proposed by sociologist E. Zerubavel seems to reflect the differences Buccellati describes between polytheism and monotheism: &laquo;The rigid mind typically envisions a highly compartmentalized world made up of sharply delineated insular entities separated from one another by great divides. The fuzzy mind, by contrast, invokes a world made up of vague essences fading gradually into one another. Instead of mental ghettos, it features mental twilight zones. Instead of clear-cut distinctions, it highlights ambiguities. Both mind-sets entail certain costs as well as certain advantages.&raquo; (p. 115) 
In concluding his work, Zerubavel proposes a flexible merging of the two ‘kinds of mind’ he distinguishes: &laquo;The world can be so much richer than the rigid mind with its either/or logic would allow us to realize. That, however, requires elastic boundaries that would not preclude multiple ways of carving up the world into ‘things.’ … Flexibility need not entail giving up structure altogether. It does imply, however, dynamic, elastic mental structures. Such structures would allow us to break away from the mental cages in which we so often lock ourselves, yet still avoid chaos. With them, we can be creative as well as secure.&raquo; (p. 122).</p>
<p>Are Zerubavel’s two ‘kinds of minds’ an echo of the polytheism/monotheism distinction, or is that distinction their product? </p>

        <p>While the concept of the &laquo;suffering just man&raquo; has been criticized when used to refer to Mesopotamian literature, Ziegler believes it is a useful concept because whether or not the sufferer was actually faultless, there are several texts in which the author believes in his faultlessness. In particular, Ludlul II 33-36 supports this interpretation: the author writes that &laquo;what is good may displease the god!&raquo; There is no clarity about why the god is angry; yet apparently it is he who is crushing the &laquo;suffering just man&raquo;. Ziegler also offers an extended catalog of symptoms of divine displeasure in several Mesopotamian texts.</p>
<p>Her analysis of suffering and reintegration through <strong>magic</strong> acts is in accord with Buccellati’s description in 13.2. Note however that Ziegler describes the relationship between the suffering just and the gods in terms that seem close to what Buccellati affirms to be exclusively biblical (13.3). The author of Ludlul, for instance, <strong>offers thanks</strong> to the god for having been healed. See also <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Buccellati2020Job">Buccellati 2020 Job</a>.</p>

The study of the archaeological and epigraphic evidence revealed a great urban centre, which, in the first phase of its development, between 2500 and 2300 BC, was in touch with great towns of Sumer, like Kish and Ur, on the one hand, and with Pharaonic Egypt on the other hand. Monumental evidence, artistic objects, material evidence mark, along one millennium, the historical path of a very old urban centre, three times destroyed, and twice rebuilt, between ca. 2500 BC and the years around 1600 BC&raquo; (from website).</p>

        <p>&laquo;The entire inventory of the <strong>cuneiform texts of literary content from Assur</strong> to be published is expected to be presented in 20 volumes, which form the monograph series ‘KAL’ (‘Keilschrifttexte aus Assur literarischen Inhalts’). On the one hand, it consists of texts that are clearly legible and can be assigned to specific text groups or ‘text types’ with defined content, on the other hand it contains highly fragmented texts that are nevertheless of great importance for further text reconstruction. It therefore seemed sensible to arrange the series in such a way that the texts that can be assigned to the text groups defined in terms of content are presented in one part of its volumes, and the less well-preserved text fragments in a second, smaller part of the volumes&raquo; (from website; English translation from German by mDP).</p>
<p>The website basically allows the download of many volumes, see specifically <a href="https://digi.hadw-bw.de/view/kal">here</a>, publishing cuneiform texts from Assur.</p>

        <p><strong>English translation of the Bible</strong> (both Old and New Testament), offered on the website of the Vatican City: &laquo;On September 30, 1943, His Holiness Pope Pius XII issued his now famous encyclical on scripture studies, <em>Divino afflante Spiritu</em>. He wrote: “We ought to explain the original text which was written by the inspired author himself and has more authority and greater weight than any, even the very best, translation whether ancient or modern. This can be done all the more easily and fruitfully if to the knowledge of languages be joined a real skill in literary criticism of the same text.” Early in 1944, in conformity with the spirit of the encyclical, and with the encouragement of Archbishop Cicognani, Apostolic Delegate to the United States, the Bishops&rsquo; Committee of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine requested members of The Catholic Biblical Association of America to translate the sacred scriptures from the original languages or from the oldest extant form of the text, and to present the sense of the biblical text in as correct a form as possible&raquo; (from website).</p>

        <p>&laquo;<strong>Shuilas</strong> are liturgical <strong>ritual-prayers</strong> that were directed to the high deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon such as Marduk, Shamash, and Ishtar, among others. A ritual official (i.e., an exorcist) recited these prayers to assist a troubled client, often a Babylonian or Assyrian king. The exorcist would read the prayer aloud and the (presumably illiterate) client would repeat the words after him. […] The present project is working tentatively with a catalog of slightly more texts, 137 prayers. The number of tablet manuscripts that bear witness to these prayers is more than twice as large—the project’s on-going catalog contains over 300 tablets—because many prayers are represented on several copies from different ancient libraries. But it is difficult to know how accurate this is since there are still many unpublished and/or uncataloged tablets and even some unpublished catalogs of tablets. This state of affairs has unfortunate results for scholars wishing to consult these prayers. For example, many unpublished textual witnesses fill gaps in otherwise incomplete prayers or present alternative readings. Often only a few specialists know about these tablets. A new edition of all shuila-prayers is therefore a pressing desiderata in Assyriology&raquo; (from website).</p>

        <p>A website displaying the Hebrew text of the <strong>Tanakh</strong> (according to the <em>Biblia Hebraica Stattgartensia</em>), together with an English parallel translation (following the <em>King James Version</em>): &laquo;TanakhML Project aims at providing scholars with efficient tools for travelling over the Bible in Hebrew, as well as with a common descriptive language for describing the structure of the Bible according to the Jewish masoretic tradition. Tanakh, in TanakhML, stands for Torah (תורה, or &ldquo;Law&rdquo;), Neviim (נביאים, or &ldquo;Prophets&rdquo;) and Ketuvim (כתובים, or &ldquo;Writings&rdquo;), that is, for the Hebrew Bible, while ML stands for XML. TanakhML is thus, stricto sensu, that specific language, described according to the XML meta-language, used to express the structure of the Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh (Tanach), as formalised by the Jewish tradition, or Masorah&raquo; (from website).</p>

        <p>&laquo;In 1883, a biblical scholar […] named Thomas Newberry designed a model, or a small, three-dimensional copy, of an ancient temple in Jerusalem, based on descriptions of its architecture that he found in the Bible. Four years later, the model was featured as the centerpiece of one of these large, public exhibitions: the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition.

        <p>An online database including information on <strong>religions</strong> (and the related sources) <strong>of the ancient Mediterranean</strong>: &laquo;Tiresias: The Ancient Mediterranean Religions Source Database provides access to references to ancient texts according to topic, mostly on religion, c. -800 BCE to 800 CE in the Mediterranean area. In some cases, direct access to full text is also available. Topic tagging is based on existing subject indices from scholarly books, allowing highly detailed topic resolution. The site is in development, and currently includes 4,729,588 keyed to 53,361 subjects&raquo; (from website).</p>
<p>The aims of this website are different and, to some extent, complementary to that on <a href="http://4banks.net/Mes-lit/title%20L.htm"><em>Mesopotamian Literature</em></a>: while the latter focuses on a critical and comparative approach on Mesopotamian and biblical concept of religion, the former simply offers information of many aspects of ancient Mediterranean religions. Although the website is still a work in progress, it represents a useful tool for researches on ancient religions. </p>

        <p>The official website of the archaeological site of <strong>Urkesh/Tell Mozan</strong>: &laquo;Urkesh, today a small village known as Tell Mozan, was a major political and religious center of the Hurrians &ndash; an elusive population of the ancient Near East. Our excavations have shown that they had developed a strong urban civilization, at the very dawn of history, some 6000 years ago. A temple dominated the ancient skyline, at the top of a built-up terrace that rivalled the nearby mountains. A large royal palace, currently under excavation, has yielded written evidence that has allowed us to identify the ancient city&raquo; (from website).</p>
