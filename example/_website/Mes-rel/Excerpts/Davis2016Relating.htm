The other two groups of prayers come from the <b><i>Book of Psalms</i></b>: the individual and communal <b>laments</b>. A performance approach allows us to talk about the rituals that utilize these prayers in two complimentary ways that are similar to how we talk about theatre in Western cultures. We can talk about a theatrical production without discussing what happens on-stage, and we can talk about what happens on-stage while ignoring off-stage elements. Because these ancient Near Eastern <b>rituals are framed domains of action</b>, we can talk about the domains themselves without entering inside of them, and likewise, we can talk about the world inside these domains while ignoring the world outside. This approach helps us better understand the bounded nature of the relationships that take place within ritual domains, and it helps us better understand how the domains themselves influence the relationships within them. This dissertation offers not only new ways to explore human-divine relationships but also new ways for understanding <b>ritual efficacy</b> in the both Israel and Mesopotamia&#148; (author's abstract on pp. vi-vii).</td></tr>

<td><font color=800000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] I understand ritual to be both a domain of <b>performance</b>, as well as a <b>quality</b> of all performance. This way, interactions that take place in recognized rituals are not entirely different than interactions that take place outside of recognized rituals. In either case, both are "twice behaved" performances, and we spend as much time practicing "everyday" social interactions as a ritual specialist might practice his or her craft; each performance restrains the <b>agency</b> of individuals and takes place within bounded and restricted <b>frames</b>. The framed domains in which all types of performance occur carry with them identities and relationships that overlay relationships that exist outside of them; because these identities are situated within cultural domains, they have <b>varying degrees of relevance</b> inside of other cultural domains. As we explore the four ancient Near Eastern rituals treated in this dissertation, we will better appreciate the <b>influence that ritual framing has on identities and relationships</b>. Understanding rituals as framed performances will allow us to explain many instances when the world within the ritual frame does not coincide with the world outside of the ritual frame.</td>

<td><font color=800000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] a performance approach to <b><i>&#353;uilla</i> rituals</b> helps us understand the <b>interaction between the supplicant and the addressed deity</b>. I have shown that <i>&#353;uilla</i> rituals are a category of ritual procedures that utilize a variety of prayers that were deemed appropriate for reestablishing a relationship with the divine sphere. The ritual provides a <b>framed environment</b> in which the world inside the ritual may not always correlate with the world outside the ritual.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] From the perspective within the world of the ritual, the prayers used in the <i>&#353;uilla</i> ritual are <b>persuasive pieces of rhetoric meant to move a social superior to action</b>. They also tell the story of a supplicant who comes before a powerful deity and who has little previous relationship with this deity. The distance between then shrinks with each successful interaction. The <b>gradual closing of the distance</b> is demonstrated by moving from 3rd person to 2nd person address, and by emphasizing the deity's power to aid individuals just before the supplicant moves to mention him or herself for the first time in the petition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] However, from the perspective outside of the ritual world, the prayers are not only rhetorical, they are <b>performative utterances that accomplish things by their enactment</b>. The entire exchange is a scripted interaction where there is no doubt as to its ending. When all the human or divine participants take part in the ritual, the results are assured; this is similar to how a <b>theatrical performance</b> will always end the same way when all the actors show up and perform their parts correctly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, from the outside perspective, we notice that the <b>roles adopted within the ritual frame are not entirely congruous</b> with the roles of either participant outside of the ritual frame. The identity and role of each participant is supplied by the ritual itself in the same way that the script of a play supplies the identities of individual actors and the relationships between them while on stage.</td>

<td><font color=800000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] We have seen that the <b><i>dingir&#353;adabba</i> creates two personas</b> &#8211; one for the <b>human</b> participant and one for the <b>god</b> &#8211; that interact with one another in a <b>prescribed way</b>. The human participant takes on the role of an individual that is afflicted and ostracized by the misdeeds that he has ignorantly committed against his divine protector. The <b>personal god</b> takes on the person of a god that has an <b>established relationship with the supplicant</b>, but the personal god is also an all-powerful and angry divine <b>judge</b> who is actively punishing the supplicant for his misdeeds. The goal, from the perspective of the supplicant, is to survive the encounter. [...] If both human and god properly participate in this performance, the outcome is as guaranteed as the end of a play; the <b>supplicant and deity will reconcile</b> with each other once more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance could be conducted in response to <b>physically manifesting symptoms</b>, observed <b>omens</b>, or it could take place on a scheduled basis as a <b>prophylactic ritual</b>. The use of the ritual when no obvious signs of divine displeasure are apparent highlights the difference between the performance happening within the ritual frame and what is observed outside of it. What happened in the ritual frame was starkly contrasted not only from the <b>"non-ritual" environment</b> but from other rituals that may even take place side-by-side in larger rituals, such as <i>b&#299;t rimki</i> or <i>b&#299;t sal&#257;&#789; m&#234;</i>.</td>

<td><font color=800000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] the individual and communal <b>laments of the Book of Psalms find a place alongside the burnt offering</b> in the Jerusalem temple. This combined performance of the lament and burnt offering is part of a <b>ritual series</b> that enacts a successful audience before Yahweh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our analysis of the laments within a ritual frame has helped us properly contextualize these prayers. In keeping with our performance approach to ritual, we are able to understand the lament ritual from two different perspectives. From one perspective, the lament ritual was a <b>unit of performative action</b>. The successful performance of the lament ritual essentially guaranteed that Yahweh would grant the petition of the supplicant. The positive reply of Yahweh was prescribed into many of the laments, and the unquestioned movement from burnt offering to peace offering demonstrates that each ritual element was expected to be efficacious upon enactment. From another perspective, however, the <b>laments are persuasive pieces of rhetoric meant to persuade</b> a divine superior to act on behalf of the supplicant(s).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the communal laments, the participants become a part of a wider community that looks to specific events of their shared past in which Yahweh has delivered them. However, Yahweh has changed his behavior and his actions have allowed the armies of their political enemies to prevail. They plead with Yahweh to intercede. In this instance, <b>Yahweh</b> takes on the role of <b>the patron deity of the community</b> who operates on the global and cosmic scale.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These performances within the ritual frame may or may not reflect the situation of the individual and community outside of the ritual frame. Although this ritual performance could be enacted in the face of impending danger to individuals and communities, it could also be enacted according to a <b>ritual calendar</b>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...] This performance approach helps us better understand how to interpret the human-divine relationships within individual and communal laments. Some ways of relating with deity are <b>restricted to specific, framed environments</b>. Seeing the different human-divine relationships attested in these two lament genres helps us understand how individuals related with Yahweh in specific rituals; this change in relationships between rituals is similar to how relationships between two individuals change depending on the social domain they are in. Since social domains, including ritual domains, have so much influence on <b>relationships</b>, we must exercise caution in extending these same relationships to other circumstances. Although we might be able to call the relationship found in individual laments a <b>"personal god" relationship</b>, it is not clear if that relationship was any more real to the supplicant than the one enacted in the communal laments. We are unsure of the other contexts within the life of the individual in which these different relationships might be activated, but it is clear that the two relationships found in the <b>individual and communal laments were clearly options for relating with Yahweh</b> during the first-millennium BCE.</td>
