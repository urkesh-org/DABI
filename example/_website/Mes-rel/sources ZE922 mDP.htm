<h4>Premise</h4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the website offers links to texts of primary sources on Mesopotamian (in Sumerian and Akkadian) and biblical literature (in Hebrew).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main goal of this section is to provide a direct link to original texts mentioned throughout the volume <i>&#147;When on High the Heavens...&#148;</i>, offering the transcription, transliteration, and English translation of document in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Hebrew.<br>

<h4>Intro</h4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section provides the full text of the <i>Appendices</i> of G. Buccellati's book <i>&#147;When on High the Heavens...&#148;</i>, offering both the transcription (both the syllabic transcription and the phonemic one) of the Akkadian texts (according to the sources chosen by the author, put on top of each <i>Appendix</i>) and their English transations (following G. Buccellati's own translation).<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Appendices</i> are here listed in their numerical order, as in the volume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, we follow that of the <i>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</i> [BHS] (available on <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/">Tanakh Project</a>).<br>
