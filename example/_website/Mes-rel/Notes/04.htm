    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="4.1">        <li id="4.1a"><p>On &ldquo;repetitive patterns&rdquo; of human perception and behavior, it is interesting to note that a strong neural correlate exists for this activity. One influential work on the issue is D. Hebb&rsquo;s <em>The Organization of Behavior</em>.

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="4.2">4.2 The Epistemological Approach</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="4.2">        <li id="4.2a"><p>The biological substrate affirmed by Yalom is coherent with the religious behavior of humans: an attempt to order random events and thereby gain control over them. The alternative presented in biblical monotheism is a radically different perspective, attending, within apparent randomness, to a &laquo;mystery&raquo;, a personal actor, who is eventually revealed as a lover. </p>
<p>Yalom also mentions what he considers a two-sided illusion common to most humans: the belief that one is special, and therefore immune to the ordinary disasters of life (death, in particular); and the belief that there is a savior, &laquo;Though we may falter, grow ill, though we may arrive at the very edge of life, there is, we are convinced, a looming, omnipotent servant who will always bring us back.&raquo; p. 34 See <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Yalom2012Love">Yalom 2012 Love</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, April 2020</p>]        <li id="4.2b"><p>In this section G. Buccellati outlined a distinction between ‘religion’ and ‘magic’; even though such a demarcation is difficult to be traced for ancient Mesopotamia, an useful discussion on this topic can be found in <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Oates1978Religion">Oates 1978 Religion</a>, dealing with the definition of ‘religion’ and the description of Mesopotamian ritual (specifically funerary) practices.  </p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, June 2020</p>]        <li id="4.2c"><p>‘Religion’ and ‘magic’ are particularly discussed in <em>chapter 12</em> of <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#vonSoden1985Einfuhrungen">von Soden 1985 Einfuhrungen</a>: the author perceives these concepts as two specific spheres (exemplified by texts of different ‘genre’) strictly connected and interacting each other.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, July 2020</p>]        <li id="4.2d"><p>The <strong>conversion of Abraham</strong> is well-known from <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PE.HTM"><em>Gen.</em> 12</a>. </p>
<p>In an apocryphal text of the Old Testament, called <strong><em>The Apocalypse of Abraham</em></strong>, in the first part it is also described the conversion of Abraham from idolatry to God. The full text of the volume publishing the apocrypha is <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Box1918Apocalypse">Box 1918 Apocalypse</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, July 2020</p>]        <li id="4.2e"><p>On the main work of <strong>Gianbattista Vico</strong> (1744 &ndash; <em>Principj di scienza nuova</em>, Napoli), see e.g. the entry by G. Buccellati on <a href="http://urkesh.org/pages/922a.htm#Vico">Urkesh.org/e-Library</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, July 2020</p>]        <li id="4.2f"><p>Buccellati&rsquo;s affirmation that divination, astrology, and magic are eminently rational procedures may suggest that these practices are the beginnings of what we call science. Oppenheim cautions against too rapid a conclusion in this sense: &laquo;Unwarranted seem to me to be the claims that the word lists with names of plants, animals, and stones, are the beginnings of botany, zöology, and mineralogy, respectively. Such claims originate in the climate of today’s opinion in which achievements in what we choose to term “science” are considered essential in an alien civilization if it is to be worthy of study. What we have to see in these numerous and diversified lists is much the same process of growth by accretion, the same preference for additive elaboration and amplification (rather than structural changes) which we can observe in Mesopotamian legal practices, in the evolution of the votive inscriptions, in the layout of a temple, to mention some few examples. A formally very simple and short pattern is utilized by the scribes to render a large variety of complex and elaborate contents. In this way the form as such does not exercise any tyranny, nor does it coerce the content, but serves as vehicle; in fact, it forms a matrix for a progressive development.&raquo; Chapter 5,  <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Oppenheim1964Mesopotamia">Oppenheim 1964 Mesopotamia</a></p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, October 2020</p>]        <li id="4.2g"><p>Buccellati&rsquo;s account of the radical difference between biblical &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and mesopotamian polytheism is reminiscent of the theological term &ldquo;event&rdquo;, as used by L. Giussani, R. Guardini, and E. Fuchs, among others. </p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, October 2020</p>]</ol>

The ‘death’ or ‘disappearing’ of a god is unbelievable and unconceivable within a monotheistic thought (believing in God as an eternal entity) while in ancient polytheist systems many examples of ‘dying gods’ can be detected (e.g. Ištaran equated to Dumuzid); cf. on this topic <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Buccellati1982Descent">Buccellati 1982 Descent</a>, dealing with the epic poem <em>Inanna’s Descent into the Underworld</em>, for which see <a href="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htm">ETCSL 1.4.1</a>). </p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, July 2020</p>]        <li id="4.3c"><p>As stressed by G.

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="4.4">4.4 Guilt and Sin</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="4.4">        <li id="4.4a"><p>A common idea (for instance in (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Bettini2014Polytheism">Bettini 2014 Polytheism</a>) holds that polytheism is more tolerant and less violent than monotheism. However, the two different religious views cannot be compared &ldquo;straight across&rdquo; and used for their civil effects. They differ at the level of grammatical structure, as it were, between transitive and intransitive verbs. – [March 2020]</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, April 2020</p>]        <li id="4.4b"><p>The difference between a law-based morality and the relationship-based <strong>morality</strong> (which includes themes such as love, pardon, mercy, and the like) that Buccellati emphasizes in the biblical tradition clarifies Mendenhall’s distinction between values and “interests” (the latter being those motivating factors referred to under the titles of power, prestige, and wealth). Mendenhall clarifies that the <strong>Kingdom of God</strong> is “the leaven—the qualitative functioning—of a transcendent factor that the Bible calls God, which is radically other than social control systems, which society benefits from, but which it can neither produce nor control” (p. 177). Laws are still necessary, but they are “simply not the way the Rule of God operates”.

<p>This passage is wholly agreeable. It is true that in ancient Mesopotamia there were not such ‘founding personalities’. Nevertheless, it is at least possible to detect some specific historical figures (mainly kings) who focused on a specific deity, in a kind of henotheism, such as Akhenaten in Egypt, elevating Aten over other gods, or <a href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8121">Nabonidus</a> at Babylon, who preferred <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/nannasuen/index.html">Sin</a> to the polyad god <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html">Marduk</a> (although, the latter’s religious ‘swing’ is still historically discussed, as, to be honest, also the former’s religious ‘revolution’).</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, July 2020</p>]        <li id="4.6b"><p>On the topic of Biblical <strong>‘alliance’</strong>, see e.g. the lemma ‘covenant’ (בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית, <em>b<sup>e</sup>rît</em>(http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Berit.pdf)) in <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Freedman2000Eerdmans">Freedman 2000 Eerdmans</a>, <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289&amp;dq=biblical+berit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pQugJGcNz8&amp;sig=ACfU3U2_bf86VT13EQsgmH9rcrfYDP0mCw&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9o8W3jKTqAhVL0aYKHan2D5sQ6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biblical%20berit&amp;f=false">pp. 288ff.</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../Mes-rel/authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, July 2020</p>]</ol>
