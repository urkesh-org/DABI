Entries are annotated and linked to specific notes or other places in the website where the work pertains. The links in the upper right of each entry refer to these notes or places. Where an annotation is missing, or replaced by a publisher's summary, the entry serves as a place holder for future annotation.

The annotations are not meant to give a summary of any given title, but only to bring out the relevance of the work for the interests of the volume *Alle origini della politica*. Square brackets are used to earmark some notes that are more explicitly expressive of the reviewer's opinion.

(Excerpts and Summaries)</a>, <a href="../sub-synopses.htm" target="gB_home">R. (Reviews and Synopses)</a>, <a href="../sub-themes.htm" target="B">Th. (Thematic excursuses)</a> and <a href="../sub-monographs.htm" target="B">M. (Monographs)</a>.<br> -->
