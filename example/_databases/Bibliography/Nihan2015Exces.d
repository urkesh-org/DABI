TO divine wrath; divine repentance

This article proposes that **two forms of divine wrath exist**: the first is a **potency of the divine** and is unified to his own actions; the second is a **separate power**, perhaps a distinct member of the divine pantheon. Within the Bible, these two forms are not entirely distinct, nor can one discern a linear progress from the first to the second, as other scholars have proposed. Rather, even in late texts that probably belong to the hellenistic period, YHWH is presented as a "divine warrior" whose wrath coincides with his person. Nihan also affirms that **divine repentance is rare or even nonexistent**. Rather than "repenting" (nḥm) YHWH sometimes "renounces the evil that he had planned to do." God's anger is "spent", but not repented of except in a few rare verses, such as Jer 42:10 and 1 Ch 21:15. "This anger, frequently described as blind and excessive, is not generally the object of any repentence; despite the contrary readings which have been proposed, the pertinence of this category applied to divine wrath in the Hebrew Bible must be legitimately called into question."
