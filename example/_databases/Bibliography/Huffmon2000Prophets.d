This paper, published in the miscellaneous volume {B}R/Nissinen2000Prophecy, describes the **figure of the prophet** at Mari, and in Assyria and Israel, focusing on similarities and peculiar differences between the status and role of this ‘technician’ within these different cultures.

[The paper exemplifies the comparative approach in the analysis of the figure of prophets between Israel and the other cultures of the ancient Near East, specifically Syrian and Assyrian prophets.]
