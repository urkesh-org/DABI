The report of the 18<sup>th</sup> excavation season (2005) at [**Urkesh/Tell Mozan**](http://urkesh.org/) is entirely devoted to the description and interpretation of the **Temple Terrace**, with a reconsideration of the two lion statuettes of Tish-atal (see here, for an [overview](http://urkesh.org/urkeshpublic/temple.htm#structure)].
 
*Paragraph 1* described the Temple Terrace and the main goals of the season, aiming at better understanding the development of the temple (from the postulated, and later confirmed, idea of tracing back to the mid-fourth millennium BC the first foundation of [**temple BA**](http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm)), to gain an interpretation of the god who was worshipped therein (i.e. the polyad god Kumarbi). A history of the research is sketched, describing previous excavations on the High Mound (from 1984 to 2004), providing also the elevation of temple BA as 470.00 m on the sea-level (*sub-paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2*); *sub-paragraph 1.3* focuses on 2005 activities, while *sub-paragraph 1.4* investigates the development and the structural components of the Temple Terrace: the **escarpment**, the [**Plaza JP**](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/JP/ugr/-frame.htm), the [**revetment wall J5**](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/J05/ugr/-frame.htm), the [**monumental access J2**](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/J02/ugr/-frame.htm), the **glacis** and the [temple BA](http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm) itself (the present form attested at least from 2400 to 2350 BC, according to middle chronology).
 
*Paragraph 2* describes the stratigraphy: specifically, *sub-paragraph 2.9* describes the scattered occupation after the end of Urkesh as sacral center (ca. 1300 BC).

*Paragraph 3* focuses on other structures related to the Temple Terrace: the revetment wall, the packing and the glacis, and the escarpment.

*Paragraph 4* deals with the **monumental staircase**, presenting structural considerations, perceptual perspectives and projections, while *paragraph 5* focuses on the Plaza, considered as a sacred space. 

*Paragraph 6* displays major objects from the Mittanian strata, such as the clay figure of pig/boar’s snout, probably connected to **ritual activities** in the area (see [here](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/XVW/UNIT-TN/J03-q.htm) for pictures), ceramics from phase 1 strata, and Late Chalcolithic sherds. 

*Paragraph 7* discusses two hypotheses dealing with the two lion-shaped statuettes of Tish-atal (revisiting their provenance and dating) and with the equation at Urkesh of **NERGAL=Kumarbi**, retracing (*sub-paragraph 7.9*) the idea of an **ideological landscapes** of the temple mound. 

[The authors attempt an interpretation of the function of different spaces on the basis of the archaeological evidence and the features of each structure; moreover, moving to the ideological perception of the sacred area, it is interesting to note how the location and physical features of the Temple mound hint to the building of an ideological landscape, affecting the mind of people living at Urkesh or in its neighbourhood.]
