(l) *Litank&#257;* is an irregular imperative Bt (attested only in NA) from *al&#257;ku* with loss of the first radical as in Ugaritic and Hebrew; on this basis one could postulate an imperative B of the form *&#39;lik.* (2) Gives new examples of the Assyrian trend to use voiced in place of voiceless stops.
