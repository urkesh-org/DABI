The morphological structure of the stem system is presented on the basis of the syntactical structure, previously established by the author in the same article. The system is based on the interrelationship of minimal pairs (syntactically), the members of which are defined both by functional and morphological opposition. Morphologically each pair is characterized by the presence or absence of specified markers 
(e.g. prefix n = passive(stem N), 
prefix 0 active (stem B) 
the only exception being the correlation 
infix t + long middle radical = factitive passive(Dt). 
prefix N normal passive(N) 
These markers are isolated without recourse to the notion of internal inflection; rather they are defined on the basis of affixation, with a uniform vowel whenever needed.
