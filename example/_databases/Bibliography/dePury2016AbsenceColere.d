TO Divine wrath; Human-God relations; Human-world relations; Priestly narrative

While **divine anger** is a normal feature of mythological representations of the gods, and is present throughout the Hebrew Bible, it **is remarkably absent from the Priestly narrative (Pg)** as defined by de Pury (a detailed outline is provided in appendix to the article). The author notes that while the Deuteronomic narrative presents a relation between humans and YHWH that looks like a vassal-sovereign relation, the Pg narrative expresses a much more open dynamic: <<In the narratives of Gen 1, 9, 17, or 23, one has the impression of the elaboration of an autonomously functioning system, a system which strives to leave each of the different partners their own dynamics, interests, and spontaneity, without measuring their behaviors by a pre-fixed standard. The divine word takes the form of an invitation rather than an order.>> (p. 193)

The author briefly explains his reasons for accepting the **Pg narrative as an autonomous document**, and for believing that it was written in the window between 539 and 525 BC. His thesis fits the euphoric character of the beginning of the post-exilic period: **God is not angry because he has no enemies**.

**Creation is without enemies**, there is no adversary in Gen 1 (de Pury criticizes the traditional reading in which the **creator** creates through the word: rather, in his view, the creator explains, defines, and announces with the word). 
Relations between humans and animals are admittedly violent. Pg is pragmatic: these relations are inevitable violent; the important thing is to preserve the long term coexistence of the inhabitants of the earth, and this is accomplished by returning the blood of the victim to the earth.

Relations between the nations, according to Pg, are essentially peaceful and inclusive. Only later, proposes de Pury, did further scribes add negative descriptions of other nations. The same is true of the **Abraham**’s family relations: in Pg, on the contrary of the canonical version of Gen 17, the whole land of Canaan is given to all the descendants of Terah, not only Abraham.  **Only in relation to Pharaoh does de Pury see a somewhat less irenic situation**; but even in relation to Egypt, the God of Pg acts with calm force, not with anger. 

[De Pury’s observations support Buccellati’s emphasis on the **radical difference** between the polytheistic pantheon, which acts in anthropomorphic ways, and the absolute transcendence of the one god of Israel, who creates and saves with <<calm force>>. This is interesting, especially because the two scholars have a nearly opposite explanation of the origin of the biblical text. For Buccellati, the Mesopotamian material in the Bible, especially the Abraham story, is much more ancient than the exilic period.]

TO Mari; nomads

Buccellati explains his reasoning in 6.6.  One especially important feature is that the nomadic shepherds who left Mari to live on the steppe were the <<first rural class in the ancient Near East to affirm their own identity and acquire a level of autonomy without precedent>> (p. 72) because they were basically unreachable by the state powers.

TO exile

It is unlikely that Mesopotamian material was imported to the Bible after the exile. First, the Mesopotamian stories are inserted into a very different narrative. It is furthermore unlikely that the Jews, who were deeply polemical with Babylon (see Ps. 137), would take foreign texts as the basis of their own religion. Thirdly, the one polemical episode (tower of Babel) fits very well with Buccellati’s hypothesis, because it would have had a positive meaning in the Babylonian context, and could be interpreted in a negative manner only if it were transposed and blurred in the memory of nomadic tribes.
