The present contribution, stemming from a conference given in November 2011 at the Catholic University of Milan, investigates the concept of the **Trinitarian aspect** within the theological, historical, and philosophical background of ancient Mesopotamian culture. This comparison may seem odd, and the author explains the reasons of such an enquiry under three points (pp. 29-30):

1) the *theological aspect* hidden behind the concept of Trinity is strictly linked to fundamental and universal characteristics of the human spirit: thus, any theological issue needs to face this peculiar conception of the divine sphere;

2) the *historical aspect* concerns Mesopotamia as the cradle where the Biblical tradition grew from: hence, Mesopotamia can be perceived as the background where the Biblical message partially shaped from;

3) the *philosophical aspect* involves the Mesopotamian religion as a kind of matrix (a ‘fossil’) expressing and representing our contemporary view on the world where our modern thought is still strictly informed by. 

In the first part of the contribution [see *infra* for TOC], the author explains the diversity between **polytheism** and **monotheism** is much more complex that what we could think: polytheism expresses a richness in spirituality which must be understood in its own original nature.

In the second part of the paper, G. Buccellati investigates how the Mesopotamian religiosity led to a clear and mere **perception of the absolute** (cf. [Buccellati 2012](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Buccellati2012a.pdf)).

In the third section, the ‘Trinitarian implications’ of this Mesopotamian view are enlightened, dismantling any contraposition and underlining how this ‘non-conflictual dynamics’ led to a sublimation of the notion of ownership, reaching a connection with the notion of ‘gift and communion’.            

The author concludes: <<The idea derived from Mesopotamia is therefore indicative of the fact that the *continuity* and *coherence* of human experience comes to our aid when we try to understand our reality today, to understand the motivation behind the altars still erected today to the unknown gods. … It is therefore up to us, if Christians, to reveal the nature of the desire behind the altar. It is a remote and perennial desire, and the study of aspirations and intuitions of the past must serve to galvanize our conscience as scholars and men. Bending over the factuality of the past and tracing its history must help us regain the vitality of the great clashes and spiritual confrontations found in it, and convey its deepest meaning, as well as when we try to discover the sense of an epochal transformation in the perception of the absolute>> (pp. 47-48).
