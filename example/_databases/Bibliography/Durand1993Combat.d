TO mythologems; Marduk

Durand's wide ranging text principally examines the creation myth involving the **mythologem of a battle** between Marduk (storm-god) and Tiamat (goddess of the sea). On the basis of ARMT XXVI/3, he proposes that this **theme existed already in 1800 BC**, in an area far from Babylon. He also believes it is found in an Akkadian myth involving a battle between Tispak and the sea, dating a millenium earlier than Marduk. This myth could have influenced the culture of Ugarit, and from there it could have influenced Babylon. This conclusion responds to the question posed by ({B}R/Jacobsen1968Battle): **the mythologem could have traveled from west to east, from Ugarit to Babylon**.

Durand notes that the mythologem is known not from a literary text, but from a foundational text for Amorite royalty, and expects that something similar will one day be found in a text from Babylon proper. The victory of Ba'al over the sea preluded to his building a palace and taking the throne, and his weapons are sent to the king in order to begin a sacred ceremony. In the same way that the god of order triumphed over the goddess of chaos, so the king must bring about justice in his potentially chaotic realm. These and other reasons lead Durand to propose that "l'accession de Marduk à la qualité de dieu d'Empire s'est passée par une adéquation progressive à l'image radieuse d'Addu d'Alep".
