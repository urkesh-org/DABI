An analytic presentation of the conjunctions found in NB letters, a corpus of about 1100 letters; 53 different conjunctions are listedin alphabetical order (most of them are compound on the basis
of 9 or 10 basic conjunctions), carefully indicating for each the notional value, the consecutio
temporum, and occasionally the word aider. An exhaustive documentation is given for each conjunction.

[I have counted a total of 993 examples in Dietrich's documentation. It isimportant to note
that 733 of these, i.e. almost 75%, are with *ki* or a compound based odn ki; in the second place of frequency 
are adi and ultu, or compounds, with 68 and 61 examples respectively, i.e. almost 15% together.
In other words, in spite of the typological wealth, the productive conjunctions are very few, and *ki* is by
far the most common; in turn *ki*, is especially common in a temporal function, with 415 examples, i.e.
about 55% of all *ki* occurrences. Structurally one lmay also note that, of the elements entering in composition, 
bi&t, la& and muh%h%i occur in final positiononly, *aki* and ultu occur alone or initial, adi, *ki*
and &#353;a occur alone, initial or final.]
