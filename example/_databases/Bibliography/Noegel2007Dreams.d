TO dreams; interpretation of dreams; allusive language

The **interpretation of dreams** in ancient Mesopotamia is attested by many texts (see e.g. {B}R/Noegel2001DreamsandDream and {B}R/Oppenheim1956Dreams; cf. also [*Appendix 11*](https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%2011_mDP.htm)). The author analyses in this contribution a specific feature of dream Mesopotamian texts, i.e. the use of an **allusive language** making the interpretation of dreams even more difficult.

[The ‘mysteries’ to be cracked in the analysis of Mesopotamian dreams are veiled by the darkness of some allusive expressions, sometimes very difficult to be translated and interpreted (also because of linguistic limits in the understanding of some Akkadian expressions); it results that also in antiquity, dreams could have been interpreted in different ways according to the different understandings of these allusive expressions.]
