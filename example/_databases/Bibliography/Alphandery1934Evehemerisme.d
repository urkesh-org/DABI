TO euhemerism

The paper briefly displays the development (during the Middle Ages) of the **euhemerism** as a way of interpreting history of religious phaenomena, and the nature of gods as perceived during the classical times and the later Middle Ages. According to the Alphandéry, during this last period, many intellectuals read the classical authors trying to find in their compositions (both in prose and in verses), the origin of specific religious (and consequently, also literary) features (such as the ‘hermeticism’, the magic, and the alchemy), sketching (throughout many literary exemplifications) a useful history of euhemerism.  

[Euhemerism is a topic discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume; the reader will find in this paper a useful historical reconstruction, along with a critical comment, of the development of euhemerism, particularly during the Middle Ages.]
