<<With the increase in knowledge of Mesopotamian incantations, through the publication of the new edition of Akkadian and Sumerian incantation series, it is now possible to search for closer cultural ties between Mesopotamian and Israelite rituals. In this vein, a **comparative study of [Lev. V. 1-5](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=5&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls) and the magical text Šurpu** suggests that the Leviticus expiatory sacrifice and Šurpu ritual were prescribed under similar conditions>> (from p. 181)

[This paper perfectly exemplifies the comparative approach between Mesopotamian and biblical sources, a topic investigated by G. Buccellati in his volume. Furthermore, the contribution offers a concrete exemplification of the comparative approach in the analysis of the *šurpu* incantations (see [*Appendix 1*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Sources/appendix 1_mDP.htm) and [*Appendix 15*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Sources/appendix 15_mDP.htm)); cf. also {B}R/Reiner1958Surpu.]
