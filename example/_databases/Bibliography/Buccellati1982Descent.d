TO descent of Inanna; ritual journey 

In this paper, the author suggests a cultic setting for the Sumerian story of the *Descent of Inanna* (p. 7).

In the first paragraph, the itinerary of [**Inanna**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna)’s journey is reported, describing the geographical framework of her peregrination towards [**Kutha**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutha), the residence of the **Netherworld gods** and her coming back to the city of [**Uruk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk). The author proposes to recognise a physical, geographical journey, starting from [**Uruk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk) (through [Larsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsa), [Bad-Tibira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad-tibira), [Umma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umma), [Zabalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabala_(Sumer)), [Adab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adab_(city)), [Nippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippur), [Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_(Sumer)), and probably [Akkad]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkad_(city))) and leading the goddess northwards to the city of [Kutha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutha), located to the north of [Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkad_(city)) (see [Map](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/Images/Buccellati1982Descent.jpg) on p. 4).

The second paragraph deals with the possible interpretation of such an itinerary as a **cultic journey** regarding the renewal of the goddess’ statue (following a suggestion by Paul Gaebelein).

Hence the conclusion: <<Within these limitations, we may conjecture further on a possible *Sitz im Leben* for the assumed ritual. This may have been an annual renewal ceremony, which may have been a part of the regular, recurrent caring of the goddess, and might have originated in response to the breaking of a given statue, whether accidental or through enemy intervention>> (p. 6).
