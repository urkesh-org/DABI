The feminine marker t was originally deictic and was then "extended" to distinguish other 
things that required to be distinguished, such as, precisely, gender; in other words the marker t "is not 
an original element distinguishing the female sex or feminine gender" (90f.). Similarly, the masculine 
form of the numeral is original, and it was originally used with nouns of either gender. When the 
numeral proceded the noun to which it referred, it was in the construct state and was taken as a collective 
(marked by the t of the feminine); if the noun was also a collective, the sequence of two collective 
was felt undesirable, and the numeral placed in the non-collective, i.e. masculine form. The "disagreement" 
was then normalized to all cases, even when no collective was present. The central part of the 
article contains documentation from the main Semitic dialects, Akkadian being treated on pp. 92-5.
