General linguistic theory postulates, in a diachromic framework, a
"renouvellement" of the perfective aspect by means of verbs of state,
and the consequent use of perfective forms to express anteriority; similarly, a "renouvellement" of the imperfective by means of durativeiterative formations, and the consequent use of imperfective forms to
express present action. In Semitic, the original perfective form was
*yaqtul* (evidenced by the Akk. preterite *ik&#353;ud* and by residues of perfective value in the WSem. jussive); in WSem., *gatala* is derived secondarily from the conjugation of verbs of state which is still alive
in the Akk. permansive. The original imperfective, on the other hand,
was *&#42;yaqatal* (= *ika&#353;ad*) next to which there was a verbal noun *yaqtulu/i/a* ; the latter was absorbed in the verbal system, the original case ending *-u/i/a* becoming specialized as a modal ending; in WSem.
(except perhaps for South Sem.) *yaqtul(u)* replaced completely *&#42;yaqatal*.
In other words, the original verbal system included only two forms,
*yaqtul* for the perfective and *&#42;yaqatal* for the imperfective; the renewal of the aspect system caused major changes only in WSem., where two
nominal forms replaced the original ones, namely *qatala* in place of
*yaqtul*, and *yaqtulu* in place of *&#42;yaqatal*.
