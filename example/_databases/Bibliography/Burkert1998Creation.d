TO sacrifices; teleology; biology; religious sense

<<Sacrifice—ranging from the sacrifice of virgins to circumcision to giving up what is most valued—is essential to all religions. Could there be a natural, even biological, reason for these practices? Something that might explain why religions of so many different cultures share so many rituals and concepts? In this extraordinary book, one of the world’s leading authorities on ancient religions explores the possibility of natural religion—a religious sense and practice naturally proceeding from biological imperatives.

Because they lack later refinements, the earliest religions from the Near East, Israel, Greece, and Rome may tell us a great deal about the basic properties and dynamics of religion, and it is to these cultures that Walter Burkert looks for answers. His book takes us on an intellectual adventure that begins some 5,000 years ago and plunges us into a fascinating world of divine signs and omens, offerings and sacrifices, rituals and beliefs unmitigated by modern science and sophistication. Tracing parallels between animal behavior and human religious activity, Burkert suggests natural foundations for sacrifices and rituals of escape, for the concept of guilt and punishment, for the practice of gift exchange and the notion of a cosmic hierarchy, and for the development of a system of signs for negotiating with an uncertain environment. Again and again, he returns to the present to remind us that, for all our worldliness, we are not so far removed from the first Homo religiosus.>> [Publisher's summary]

TO finality; biology

An interesting parallel to Buccellati's reasoning about the "finality" of religion can be found in S. Talbot's work on [form](https://bwo.life/bk/form1.htm).

TO finality; teleology

Buccellati's use of the word **"finality"** in reference to the inescapable character of death (for example) is not exactly the same as the Aristotelian theme of teleology, but it is related. Death is given as a negative example of a *telos* toward which human life inexorably proceeds. **The inexorability of the outcome, notwithstanding the varieties of the way it is reached, is what characterizes the encounter with the Absolute.** The same dynamic obtains, as Buccellati points out, in the explicit or tacit acceptance of the rules of logic in a discourse. Note how this analogy between the inevitability of death and the inevitability of logic, in the first section of the book, provides the structural basis for the ensuing discussion and conclusions regarding religion. Buccellati's definition: **<<Religion is thus the codification of this polarity between the human sphere of the relative and that of the absolute.>>** (1.1)
