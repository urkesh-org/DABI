TO Satan

In this brief paper, the author presents a philological and etymological analysis of the term **Satan** used to identify the principal opponent to God in the Bible. The etymology of the term clearly defines Satan as ‘the’ opponent to God *par excellence*.

[Besides the philological analysis, the author contextualises the term in its original historical context, stressing in his etymological query the possible contacts with Semitic terms from Mesopotamia and the Levant.]
