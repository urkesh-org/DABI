TO divination; astrology; Enūma Anu Enlil

This fundamental book offers an in-depth description of **Mesopotamian astrology** and **divination** mostly based on a text called in Akkadian ***Enūma Anu Enlil***. A particular focus is on the Chaldean and Assyrian astronomy, describing the most important sources for the analysis of this ancient ‘science’: *kudurru*, manuals for the interpretation of astral movements, celestial observations of over two thousand years before Christ, monthly calendars with glorious and nefarious days, personal horoscopes and part of the close correspondence between the Assyrian rulers and the court astrologers.
