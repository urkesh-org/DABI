A critical review of CASTELLINO 1962 *System* objecting especially to the following: lack of clarity with respect to basic methodological presuppositions, esp. the distinction between synchronic and diachronic levels and between inductive and deductive approaches (the latter being equated by Von Soden with structuralism); insufficient sense for the historical development underlying the "Hamitic" documentation; vagueness of conceptual categories such as with demonstratives (which are made to include the anaphoric pronoun), with the definition of the D-stem as intensive or of the ventive as emphatic; the lack of a real confrontation with textual material (which Von Soden considers indispensable at least in one language); the inadequate philological basis on which linguistic conclusions are made to rest, a difficulty, this, more easily found in Akkadian than in any other field of Semitic studies (in Assyriology one cannot be certain to translate *always* correctly even at the elementary level, p. 172).
