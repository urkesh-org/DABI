<<In 2011, we launched new excavations and a re-analysis of one of the key sites for such early discoveries, the collapsed rock shelter of **Abri Blanchard**. In 2012, we discovered in situ a limestone slab engraved with a complex composition combining an aurochs and dozens of **aligned punctuations**. … The aligned punctuations find their counterparts at Chauvet, in the south German sites and on several other objects from Blanchard and surrounding Aurignacian sites. In sum, we argue that dispersing Aurignacian groups show a broad commonality in graphic expression against which a certain number of more regionalized characteristics stand out, a pattern that fits well with social geography models that focus on the material construction of identity at regional, group and individual levels>> (from authors’ abstract).

[In this paper, the authors describe some artefacts found at the site of Abri Blanchard, in SE France: specifically, one relevant object is presented, a bone fragment (dated ca. 30.000 BP) with a registration of the moon phases, interpreted by scholars (including [Buccellati, G. 2014](http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm), pp. [28-29](http://urkesh.org/attach/GBDalProfondo.pdf#page=29]) as one of the most ancient calendars found thus far.]
