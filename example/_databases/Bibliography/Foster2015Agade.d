TO empire of Akkad

This book offers an **analytic study of the Akkadian period of Mesopotamian history**, which saw the rise and fall of the world’s first empire. The author offers his definition of "empire" at p. 83: «”Empire” is used here in its conventional sense of supreme and extensive political dominion, presided over by dynastic rulers, who claimed extraordinary, even superhuman or divine powers. It was an entity put together and maintained by force, with provinces administered by officials sent out from the capital in the heartland.» (p. 6).
The book begins with a well-grounded historical framework of the rise and fall of Akkad, from Sargon to Sharkalisharri. Foster offers an overview of the people and land of Akkad, including the socio-religious structures of the empire; he makes use of both epigraphical and archaeological sources. Within his discussion of Akkadian centers and settlements, the author offers two maps (at pp. 51, 81) which help conceptualizing the geography of the Akkadian Empire and the relationship between the various civic centers. Foster then analyzes many aspects of the everyday life in this period: agriculture (and diet), ceramic, economy and production; he discusses at length religion and temples as well as politics and military - through which the Akkadian Empire enabled trade, business, and economic growth. Finally, the scholar discusses art and literacy in this historical period (a few original sources are also available in translation in the appendixes at the end of the book), including the human values and expression of identity of this specific culture. The last chapter, then, explores how the Empire has been presented in modern historiography, from the decipherment of cuneiform to the present.
