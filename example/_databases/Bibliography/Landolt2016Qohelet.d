TO divine wrath; Qohelet

This study on divine anger in **Qohelet** notes that the theme is nearly absent, except in the fifth chapter. While other contemporary wisdom literature, notably Pr 1-9, speaks of divine anger, the view in Qohelet is dominated by a creation ethos: <<it goes differently in Qohelet, for whom wisdom is the observation of the world, and for whom the god, Elohim like in Gen 1, is exclusively the creator of the world as it is, and without intervening further.>> (p. 283) Thus the radical questioning of **divine retribution** that is proper to the problem of **theodicy**, in Qohelet takes the form of a <<reverence that marks the distance between man in finished creation, and the creator god.>> (p. 283).
