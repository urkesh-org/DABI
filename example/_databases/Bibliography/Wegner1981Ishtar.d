This book is completely devoted to the presentation of the features and cult of the goddess **Ištar-Šawuška** in **Asia Minor**.

The volume is divided into 11 chapters after an introduction about the textual sources, their dating and the description of the goddess herself. 

*Chapter 1*: the Hurrian Šawuška in the Mesopotamian tradition. 

*Chapter 2*: the role of the goddess’s cults during the Hittite Empire (after 1370 BC).

*Chapter 3*: appearance and nature of the goddess. 

*Chapter 4*: her position into the **pantheon** and **myths** related to her. 

*Chapter 5*: **cult-inventory texts**. 

*Chapter 6*: **cult-calendars** and **festivals** for the goddess. 

*Chapter 7*: offering and ritual for the goddess. 

*Chapter 8*: cult of the goddess. 

*Chapter 9*: priests and **cultic personnel** of the goddess. 

*Chapter 10*: diffusion of the goddess’s cult and her **devotional places**. 

*Chapter 11*: the reverberation of the goddess’s cult to the Mediterranean.

[Particularly interesting is the reference to the cult of this goddess at [**Urkesh/Tell Mozan**](http://urkesh.org/), since her cult in this ancient North-Syrian city could be one of the earliest attested, so far.]
