<<The nature of **divine speech** in Antiquity in the **Mediterranean Basin** has often been the object of scholarly analysis, especially regarding its **divinatory context** and questions of **genre** and **rhetoric**. The present volume not only provokes a dialogue with this past research but seeks to respond to a problem that has received little consideration until now: the **articulation of divine speech** with the various forms of its representation (linguistic, literary, and material). The aim is to analyse the nature of divine speech through its **materiality** and the impact of the latter on the formerâ€™s definition and evolution.>> (Authorsâ€™ abstract). 

This volume collects 9 contributions about the topic of the **communication** between ancient gods and human beings as it was perceived in different Mesopotamian cultures. 

[The entire volume offers a **multidisciplinary approach** to the topic, displaying contributions including the major cultures of ancient pre-classical and classical world. This approach allows to identify peculiarities of each religious system, stressing similarities and differences between the various religious thoughts in antiquity (specifically for what concerns the encounter with the divine speech).]
