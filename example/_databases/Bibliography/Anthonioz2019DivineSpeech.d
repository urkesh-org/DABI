TO divine speech

This volume aims to investigate the way divine speech is articulated and mediated in various societies of the past by making use of a comparative approach. It has a strong focus, thus, on the 'materialization' of divine speech and the importance of artefacts as media. Two contributions are particularly relevant for Buccellati's discussion on prophecy in Ancient Mesopotamia and the Bible.

Martti Nissinen ("Oracles as Artefacts: The Material Aspect of Prophecy", pp. 49-64) shares with Buccellati's approach a particular attention towards the temporal and cultural gap that exists between the modern readers and the people who produced and used the original texts. In this essay, he gives a brief presentation of four case-studies: an oracle collection from Nineveh; the Deir Alla inscription; the compilation of inscriptions from the Phrygian Hierapolis; and the scrolls containing "biblical" texts among the Dead Sea Scrolls. He considers these sources as material objects which are ultimately the results of a process of communication starting from the (possible) prophetic performance, the writing of the text to the audience, and the afterlife of the artefact carrying the message.

St&#233;phanie Anthonioz ("Biblical Prophecy: Writing and Media Associated", pp. 65-80) opens her contribution with a definition of prophecy: <<when a person, through some cognitive experience (vision, audition, apparition, dream or else) becomes the recipient of a divine revelation and is conscious to be sent to reveal it by speech or symbolical gesture to a precise audience.>> (p. 65) She is aware, however, that this is an '-etic' definition, which highlights the principle of communication upon which the prophetic practice is based. Prophecy, she maintains, is subject to a continuous recontextualizations, linked to its transmission - and the question of the medium becomes essential to the very definition of prophecy and of its function. The author, thus, addresses the question of the relation between the prophetic word and its medium in biblical texts, analysing two specific instances: the book of the law as divine speech revealed to Moses, and prophetic books in relation with the scrolls when these are textually referred to.
