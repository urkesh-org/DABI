TO Dan 2; dreams; Daniel

<<[Chapter 2](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=35&prq=2&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls) of the Book of Daniel is devoted in its entirety to Nebuchadnezzar’s dream and its unusual recapturing and interpretation by Daniel. […] What is the purpose of this dramatic story, in which Daniel acts as a reincarnation of Joseph but in even more demanding circumstances? What is the message that those who included this story in a book of the canon hoped a reader will deduce? Assuming that the story is factual and, despite some historical inaccuracies, occurred at the beginning of the Babylonian Exile, was it intended to serve as a model for Jewish behavior in the Diaspora? Was Daniel’s behavior supposed to serve as a paradigm for the Jew in exile? The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on these issues>> (p. 231).

[This paper focuses on the role of interpreters of dreams in the Bible, confronting the figures of Joseph (in *Gen* [37](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=37&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls) and [41](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=41&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls)) with that of the prophet Daniel.]
