The author investigates the textual, iconographic, and archaeological evidence of northern Mesopotamia in the mid-third millennium BCE, as this is considered to be an arena which saw an important cultural revolution that transformed how people within nascent states understood their communities. This article in particular aims to explore **the power dynamics that led to inclusive and exclusive political strategies and free and limited access to political and ritual spaces in cities and in the countryside**.
In the first section of this paper, Ristvet focuses on how building programs in northern Mesopotamia created specific spaces that at the same time expressed and established royal power. Then, issues connected to **ritual travel and pilgrimage** and their connections with the negotiation of political authority in early states are discussed. The author aims to prove that **processions and pilgrimages were crucial to the development of a cognitive schema that made sense of the newly created polities**. Indeed, Ristvet argues that «The rise of the state coincided with the creation of a complex religious landscape, where multiple pilgrimage routes arose which probably coincided with, and sometimes cross-cut, the territories of specific polities.» (p. 8).
