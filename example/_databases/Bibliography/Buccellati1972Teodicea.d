This paper analyses a famous text of the Mesopotamian literature known as **Babylonian Theodicy**, which is close to the Biblical composition regarding Job. The author leads the reader through an analysis of the conceptual scheme of the composition, underlining the dialogic form of the text, involving a discussion between the suffering man (called by his interlocutor as *na’du ibru*, ‘honoured friend’) and a sage (called in Akkadian *āšišu*). 

Several questions are presented by the ‘friend’, followed by an answer given by the ‘sage’. In general, the ‘sage’ answers question by question, revealing in sum that the only solution to fight all the aforementioned evils are two virtues: piety and humility, based on faith in gods’ willing. 

Nevertheless (and that is the topic of the present contribution) the ‘friend’ stresses the apathy (‘abulia’) of the general people towards the suffering condition of the simple man (a topic that recalls many other wisdom composition, such as the aforementioned *Book of Job*, but also some Egyptian text, such as the *Dispute between a man and his Ba* (see [here](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SlW0CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+ancient+Egyptian+soul&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20ancient%20Egyptian%20soul&f=false) for a preview by J.P. Allen); the ‘sage’ provides the ‘friend’ with a theological explanation for such a human behaviour: the gods, indeed, creating mankind, gave to each man <<as heredity forever not the truth, but the falseness>> (p. 162), from the original Akkadian *sarrāti u lā kīnāti išrukūšu* (line 280).

On p. 163 the author offers a discussion about the compositive unity of the poem, presenting a first section of questions and answers, a turning point (an acme) of reflections on the human condition, and a third, conclusive, part where the ‘sage’ embeds the pains of his ‘friend’, communicating the universality of the human condition of suffering, underlining how the origins of all the evils is the apathy (or a lack in empathy [for this topic, see e.g. [Buccellati, Kelly Buccellati 2014](http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm)]) of the humankind: the only possible solution is to trust gods’ good-willing.
 
An appendix (pp. 165-178) offers a formal and thematical analysis of the composition.

[The contribution displays an example of the comparative approach, presenting texts from the Bible, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian literature, all related to the topics of the ‘righteous sufferer’, theodicy, and human apathy towards the suffering of another man. Since men seem not to prove any empathy for the sorrow of another human being, the only solution against desperation is in the end faith in the impenetrable will of god(s).]
