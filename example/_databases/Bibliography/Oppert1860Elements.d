The first complete grammar, articulated in 9 chapters and 249 paragraphs, with transcriptions in Hebrew characters. Apart from two brief
chapters on phonology and even on syntax, the bulk of the article is
on morphology. Internal inflection with respect to the nouns is treated in ch. VIII: it distinguishes primitive nouns and nouns derived
from a verbal root, and gives the main patterns, simple and with consonantal augment. The noun is treated in ch. II: the notion of "mimmation" is introduced, which is considered typical of the "emphatic
state"; the construct state is not treated expressly, though under the
name "simple state" it is referred to occasionally (111, 117, 388),
but on the whole it is not yet well understood (see e.g. the paradigm
on p. 120 f.). The pronoun is treated in chs. Ill - IV, the numerals
in ch. V, the invariables in ch. VII (the adverbial value of *-i&#353;* is
already noted). By far the largest is chapter VI on the verb
(about forty pages, almost half of the entire grammar). Only one tense is recognized, the "aorist" (i.e. the preterite); the existence
of a "perfect" (permansive) is considered but immediately denied; similarly, only two moods, imperative and precative (347 f.; ventive
forms are noted in passing, e.g. 346 n. 1, 374, and considered paragogic or euphonic in nature) and only two verbal nouns, infinitive
and participle. [This reduction of verbal forms will remain typical
of the early French tradition, vs. the German and especially the English position; the latter had already been authoritatively voiced by
HINCKS 1855-56 "Verbs."] Of the "voices" (stems) *th* is missing,
whereas an *aphel* and an *ittaphal* are noted. Patterns from weak roots
are treated in some detail, and quadriradicals mentioned briefly.â€”
In general the documentation is quite limited (though it is interesting to note that it already makes reference to Hammurapi, p. 394),
whereas paradigms are given very generously.
