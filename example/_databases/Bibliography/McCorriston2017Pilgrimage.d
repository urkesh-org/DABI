TO pilgrimage; processions

In the opening paragraphs of this article, the author defines pilgrimage (which is said to embrace many characteristics, such as mobility, affirmation of social identity, material and economic exchanges, punctuated and/or habitual participation, and dramatic rites) as «a socially-constituting framework with refracted practices across a long timeframe». **Inter-cultural pilgrimage, instead, is «a time-space edge bringing together different socio-cultural communities.»** (p. 11)
McCorriston poses the question of how to identify pilgrimage in the archaeological record, and proposes a variety of case-studies from the Neolithic period on. Ultimately, the scholar's goal is to prove that **pilgrimage provided inter-cultural spaces to integrate peoples of different cultural backgrounds**. «Inter-cultural pilgrimage was a process of appropriation and federalization of pilgrimage places that took place during the emergence of state political identity.» (p. 19) Considered as federalizing tactic, thus, pilgrimage would have provided to ancient political entities the framework for social constitution of multi-ethnic polities in which differences among different social groups would be manifested through pilgrimage practices carried out withinin shared spaces.
