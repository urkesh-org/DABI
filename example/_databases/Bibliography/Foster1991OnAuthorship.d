In this article, Foster analyzes the few works of Akkadian literature whose authors can be identified - thus including the poem of Erra. At pp. 19-21, the author discusses the final lines of the composition and he synthesizes its contents as follows: <<This passage contains [1] a summary of the story (lines 40 4l), and then [2] increasingly elaborate references to the text of the poem itself: **first as a text with a human author** (line 42)**, then as a revelation of Ishum, the divine protagonist of the poem, a revelation acceptable and pleasing to Erra, the subject** (lines 45 46). Thereupon, **with that divine acceptance, the text becomes [3] a "sign" (*ittu*) of Erra** (line 47), that all the gods will heed and respect to their advantage (lines 49 50), and then [4] a "naming" of Erra (lines 51, 56, 6l), [5] a "praising" of him (lines 52, 60), and, at last, [6] a "song" to be performed as well as studied and transmitted in centers of learning (lines 53 57). Actual manuscripts of the poem could be talismans against harm (lines 57 58).>>

Interestingly, Foster looks for - and finds - similar features in other Akkadian texts whose explicitly-mentioned author refers to the genesis, divine approval of, composition and authority of his text. And yet, *Erra* is the only poem in which all these features are present at the same time.

The scholar then explains the presence (or, rather, absence) of the author's name in Akkadian literature in light of the preference of Mesopotamian artistic tradition to stress the outside source of the inspiration for the text, so as to make the works unique and significant. Indeed, the "inspired uniqueness" of such works was stressed by poets themselves - so that the texts represented the climax of their own narratives. Considered to be an act of naming or praise (see points [4] and [5], above), it was paramount to give the name of the subject praised - while the absence of the praiser's name provided the text with an aura of universality.
