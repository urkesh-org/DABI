<<This study aims to examine the view that in Ancient Mesopotamia the lay citizen was relatively devoid of **personal religious devotion and beliefs**>> (from author’s abstract on p. ii).

[This thesis focuses on aspects of **personal prayer** in ancient Mesopotamia, with a particular focus on the participation of people in liturgies, personal devotion in ritual practices, and private devotion towards personal gods.]
