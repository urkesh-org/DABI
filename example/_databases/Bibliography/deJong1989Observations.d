<<Recently, while preparing for publication two new oracular texts from the archive of the Old Babylonian Kititum temple of Ishchali, I had occasion to review the literature dealing with ancient Mesopotamian prophetic texts and practices. Much of that literature focuses on the reports of prophetic activities found at Old Babylonian Mari and on the so-called “Akkadian prophecies.” Several much-discussed problems concern terminology: What terms should be used to describe the Mesopotamian texts? Do they reflect prophetic practice or an apocalyptic world-view, or are they merely the result of scholarly speculation? Are they native, or imported from the West? Beyond the basic problem of labelling the Mesopotamian sources and the phenomena they portray loom other questions: How do they relate to other Mesopotamian practices vis-a-vis communication with the divine? What are the connections between the various types of Mesopotamian texts that use the same or related materials? Even a cursory appraisal of the available literature shows the existence of a number of assumptions that on closer examination can be demonstrated to need modification or even to be altogether untenable. The material for the Mesopotamian side of the discussion includes both newly available texts and new interpretations>> (from author’s *Introduction*, p. 127).

[This paper raises some fundamental questions about ‘Assyrian prophecies’, rediscussing some terms referring to oracular texts and questioning the possible connection between oracular texts and other Mesopotamian documents.]
