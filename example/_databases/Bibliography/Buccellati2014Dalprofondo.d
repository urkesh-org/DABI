TO calendars; necromancy; religious thought

After a foreword (by Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati) and an introduction by the author, the book is divided into 4 chapters, dealing with topics about [Urkesh/Tell Mozan](http://urkesh.org/) and another site in Georgia, namely Dmanisi.
      
Specifically interesting to our purposes are Chapters 2 and 3: the first focuses on the recent excavations at Dmanisi, Georgia: the human finds can tell us a story of people who lived some millennia BP, presenting some important and profound interrogatives about humanity in general and also about the development of the first hominids, at the dawn of the first human communities elaborating craft skills, special competence, **religious thoughts**, and aspects related to sociality and mutual assistance.

Chapter 3 deals with some aspects on these first community of hominids (around 30000 BP) who started elaborating some abstract concepts (in logical thought) related to time-calculation (the ability of observe and record on artefacts, the **first calendars**, the **moon phases**), the growing of an extra-somatic perspective, the elaboration of language as a base for the elaboration of writing systems.

Moreover, the last part of Chapter 4 particularly focuses on the so-called **‘necromantic pit’** discovered at [Urkesh/Tell Mozan](http://urkesh.org/), known as ***âbi*** in the Hurrian language.
