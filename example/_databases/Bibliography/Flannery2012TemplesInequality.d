The authors suggest that a linear trajectory towards inequality accompanied the advent of **temples** as they evolved from smaller "ritual houses", implying that societal growth and development laid the foundation for **hierarchical** injustice. This chapter seeks to investigate whether **inequality** can be detected through **archaeology**. "Elite" child burials, a trade economy of luxury goods, and evidence of deliberate burning of residences linked with nobility all suggest the growing presence of socio-economic division. The chapter is divided by focus between **Northern** and **Southern Mesopotamia**, recognizing societal differences between regions and attributing that to rainfall and proximity to river systems. It is argued that the growth of **agricultural industries** saw an increase in the division of labor ultimately leading to the extension of familial units. Development of defensive boundaries at sites such as **Tell es-Sawwan** and **Tell Hassuna** illustrate heightened tensions. **Halaf ware** pottery types are investigated with respect to long-distance trade and within their archaeological provenience to suggest patterns of **social inequality**. Case studies of **Tepe Gawra* and the **Temple of Eridu** are highlighted for the continued use from the earliest **Ubaid** levels, tracing their architectural development over time, detailing the socio-economic aspects that can be deduced archaeologically.
