TO monotheism; divine beings; angels; demons

Schenker defines **monotheism** as the transcendence of one god over the others, not necessarily the complete non-existence of other gods. <<In order to speak of monotheism in truth, it is sufficient that there be a face-to-face between a unique god on one hand and all the other divine beings on the other.>> (p. 438) He proceeds to examine three texts that support his thesis. 

(1) Dt 32:8-9, which evokes a plurality of national religions, each with a national god, but over which ‘elyon  (who is the same as YHWH, in Schenker’s view) presides. Therefore, <<by recognizing and adoring their gods, the nations indirectly recognize and adore YHWH>> (p. 441).

(2) Mi 4:5, which looks toward the eschatological end of religions.  There are numerous religions, the passage claims, but the other gods will only exist for a time, while YHWH will live for ever.

(3) Ps 82 is most correctly interpreted as a pantheon of gods who have been unfaithful to their task, and have caused disorder. This solution implies that the poor governance is not imputable to YHWH, and solves the problem of theodicy. (See also <a href=”bibl-quando.hrm#Mastema”> Mastema</a>).

Schenker concludes that these texts taken together attribute a double transcendence to one god: he transcends both the realm of men and that of a divine pantheon of lesser gods. However, that pantheon is also properly ‘divine’, insofar as it is above the human realm. (See <a href=”bibl-quando.hrm#Smith2001”>Smith</a>’s book, which is ambiguous on this point: <<what is an ilu (god)>>). For Schenker, it is a <<simultaneously monotheistic and polytheistic conception that we see affirmed in these texts.>> (p. 445). For mostly onomastic reasons, he believes there was a <<monotheism of transcendence in Israel before the exile.>> (p. 448) 

Schenker also connects the existence of a pantheon of gods to the celestial court that would later be known as **angels**.

TO multiplicity; ontological difference; homousios

Numerical **multiplicity** is not the correct category to understand mono/polytheism, in Buccellati’s view. Rather, the difference is between a quantitative accumulation of finite elements, and a non-quantitative **ontological difference**. In later terms, the question can be addressed through the lens of Christian theology and the *homousios* terminology. See Florensky, *The Pillar and the Ground of the Truth*. See also G. Cantor for the concept of infinity.
