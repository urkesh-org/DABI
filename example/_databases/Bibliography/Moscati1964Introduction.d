Based on the previous Italian edition entitled
*Lezioni di Linguistica Samitica* (Roma 1960),
this is the latest general expose of comparative
Semitic grammar. More than in any of its predecessors, the book places considerable importance on Akkadian, for which the author
had the advice of W. Von Soden. The clear and up-to-date presentation of the material will help especially in placing Akkadian
within the wider framework or the other Semitic languages. See K.H. Deller, *Or. NS* 34 (1965) 35-44.
