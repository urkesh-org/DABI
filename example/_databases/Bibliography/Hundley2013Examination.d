This article aims to offer a synthetic analysis of the Mesopotamian divine sphere, by gathering and summarizing years of scholarly study (for which a rich and extremely useful bibliography is provided). After examining what was a "god" in ancient Mesopotamia and the essential qualities of Mesopotamian deities, Hundley discusses the relationship existing between the various deities, and between a single deity and its various aspects. He suggests that the Mesopotamian divine world was characterized by a fluidity which is difficult to understand or to compare with modern western religions.

According to Hundley, while anthropomorphism is the most prominent characteristic of the Mesopotamian divine, it does not entirely explain it. He looks for the original characteristics of deities in the original Mesopotamian sources, and states that they could be identified in at least three distinct ways: 1) by the use of the divine determinative; 2) in addition to such labeling, they could be called "gods" explicitly or behave in ways which were thought to be characteristic of the gods; 3) they could receive food offerings in the temples. On the iconographic side, there were signs that pointed to the divinity of visually depicted beings (such as the horned crown).

Deities were very often anthropomorphic, but there were non-anthropomorphic gods as well, together with human-animal or animal-animal hybrids and even inanimate beings (stars, planets, and other celestial bodies; natural phenomena and elements; human-made objects; abstract elements). The "minimal quality" which seems to have been applied to Mesopotamian deities was the ability to positively or negatively affecting humanity. In addition to this potency, other various other qualities were recognized to supernal entities, *in primis* awesomeness (the ability to elicit fear, fascination, and humility) and a divine radiance (especially in the first millennium BCE).

Hundley, then, investigates the Mesopotamian pantheon - considering it as a holistic ordering of the world, with a specific deity assigned to the areas of the cosmos they deemed important: the pantheon, then, reveals the ancient Mesopotamian attempt to understand and somehow even control the earthly world. He actually considers Mesopotamian gods as "divine constellations", in which the various elements are connected to a more or less unified entity and share in its identity. In other words, each major god consists of a constellation of aspects, which may act and be treated (semi-)independently." (pp. 80-81)
