This paper presents some reflections about the methodological approach in comparing texts of the Bible with the documentation of ancient Near East and Egypt.

On the occasion of a celebration in honour of [Giovanni Rinaldi](http://www.summagallicana.it/lessico/r/Rinaldi%20Giovanni.htm) (promoter of the periodical *Bibbia e Oriente*), the author presents some remarks on the **comparative method**, considered by G. Rinaldi as <<*one* exegetic method>>, aiming at <<grasping the spirit of the world in which the Bible is, so to speak, embodied … [to] acquire the sensitivity necessary to assimilate and enjoy its values>> (p. 152). As scholars, our aim is <<to recreate the historical conditions which facilitate the understanding of past events and institutions>> (p. 152). This research of the ancient *Weltanschauung* leads the author to explain his view and method through three **practical examples**: a first comparison of the list of the tribes of Israel ([*Jos.* 15-19](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P5T.HTM)) with a similar Sumerian list; a second comparison is presented offering in synopsis [*Ps.* 104](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=104&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls) and the text of the [***Hymn to Aten***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hymn_to_the_Aten); the last comparison is offered displaying a passage from the New Testament ([*Jms.* 5, 12](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P11Z.HTM)) with an Akkadian compendium of magical spells known as [*shurpu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0urpu) [see *Shurpu* II 6, in Reiner, E. 1958, *Shurpu. A Collection of Sumerian and Akkadian Incantations*, Graz, p.  [13](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Reiner1958_13.pdf).

The relationships and communal features between the three examples are explained on p. 156: <<The common denominator of all three examples is the fact that the texts are close enough to justify their comparison, but at the same time they are different enough to make the comparison mutually fruitful and clarifying>>.
