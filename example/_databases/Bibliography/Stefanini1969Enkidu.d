This paper publishes the Hittite parallel version ([**CTH 341**](https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/CTH/index.php?l=Gilgame%C5%A1)) of the passage of the Epic of Gilgamesh related to **Enkidu’s dream**.

[The comparison with the Akkadian ‘canonical’ version of this epos reveals many common traits between the two traditions and some differences due to local adaptation of the Mesopotamian original narrative.]
