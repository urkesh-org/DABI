In the opening paragraphs of this article, Lambert defines morality as follows: "Morals in any age can be divided into two categories: the standards actually practised among the mass of the population, and the ideals proclaimed by thinkers or prophets" (p. 185). He investigates Mesopotamian literature, looking for evidence of morality: in particular, he believes that two types of written sources may be particularly relevant, namely direct moral exhortations, and hymns which contain sections devoted to ethics (such as the hymn to Shamash, Buccellati's App. 3). Other texts are used in this paper as examples of indirect materials throwing light on Mesopotamian moral standards (*Shurpu*, legal documents, law codes).

Lambert thinks that from these texts (which are often made up of short mutually independent paragraphs, such as could easily be committed to memory) one might obtain a glimpse of the moral standards of ordinary people. He believes that morality stemmed from the very idea of Mesopotamian cosmology: the universe had been created by the gods, and humanity came into being with the almost only goal to serve the divine world. Therefore, to fulfil the divine commands was considered right, while neglecting to do so implied committing a sin. Any punishment or reward for bad or pious behaviour was expected to take place in the earthly life, since in ancient Mesopotamia there was no hope for any bliss in the afterlife.

Not only the physical universe was a divine creation, but every aspect of human society was equally a divine gift (such as kingship, which "descended from heaven"). This theory had social implications: if all human institutions had been created by the gods, to disregard or attempt to alter them would have been a sin.
