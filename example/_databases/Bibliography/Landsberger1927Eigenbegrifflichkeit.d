Understanding a foreign culture implies establashing a relationship with it, on the basis
of the human spirit. But in so doing, one
should look for the peculiarity, idiosyncrasy
or conceptual singularity ("Eigenbegrifflichkeit") of any given culture, rather than
attempting to reduce it to a fixed value system.
Starting from such presuppositions, the author
recognizes as basic to the Akkadian *verb*
various contrasting pairs, namely: (1) punctual
or momentary (*i-ka&#353;ad*) vs. durative (*ka&#353;id &
i-ka&#353;ad*): (2) the durative can in turn be
either stative (*ka&#353;id*) or fientive (*i-ka&#353;ad*):
(3) the fient ive can in turn be divided_into
meaning categories, such as voluntary (*d&#363;k* "to
kill") and involuntary (*m&#363;t* "to die"). The
*noun* can be recognized as such not on the basis 
of inflectional categories, but because it
describes a concrete object and does not
develop into a verbal root (thus in Akkadian
one does not say of the snow that it "snows "
p. 363). There are very few such nouns, and
they cannot be grouped into meaning categories.
This is in contrast with the trend typical of
Sumerian spirit and language, to classify
objects and concepts. The article ends with
a comparison of Sumerian and Akkadian "spirit"
in religion, science and poetry.
