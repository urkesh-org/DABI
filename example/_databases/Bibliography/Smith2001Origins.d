TO monotheism; polytheism; El; Yahweh

Smith's study **downplays a radical difference between monotheism and polytheism**. He believes that **El was the original god of Isra-el, and was originally distinct from Yahweh**. **Monotheism, then, would seem to be the distillation of an older pantheon**, in which one figure (Yahweh) was so emphasized that he eclipsed all others, including El. 

According to Smith, the rhetoric of monotheism probably emerged shortly before the exile. <<With the heightened importance of the national god and the centrality of the national shrine in Jerusalem, eventually both human and divine power coalesced into one central authority, serving both human monarch and divine king.>> Foreign imperial powers also aided the push toward monotheism, in Smith's view. <<Monotheistic claims made sense in a world where political boundaries or institutions no longer offered any middle ground. In its political and social reduction in the world, Israel elevated the terms of its understanding of its deity's mastery of the world. Thus, monotheism is not a new stage of religion but a new stage of rhetoric in a situation never known prior to the threat of exile.>> 

Smith claims that <<within the Bible, monotheism is not a separate <<stage>> of religion in ancient Israel, as it is customarily regarded. It was in fact a kind of ancient rhetoric reinforcing Israel's exclusive relationship with its deity. **Monotheism is a kind of inner community discourse**. Smith objects that <<biblical texts do not deny the power of other deities outside this <<local>> framework. This approach also tends to ignore biblical criticisms against polytheism and the claims of most scholars that Israel knew the cult of 'Yahweh and his asherah.' Thus, claims of 'practical monotheism,' 'de facto monotheism,' 'virtual monotheism,' or even 'monolatry' overlook the biblical evidence to the contrary, retrojecting onto 'biblical Israel' a singularity of divinity that the Bible itself does not claim for ancient Israel. ... the Bible as a whole simply does not teach the existence of only one God.>>

In the interest of maintaining strict monotheism, the Bible delimits the presence of spiritual beings other than YHWH. However, there are many different spiritual beings even in the Bible, and their character is not greatly dissimilar to the Mesopotamian demonology. By downplaying the structural radicality of monotheism, and simultaneously leaving the concept of demons somewhat ambiguous, Smith's thesis is weakened. See: {B}R/Smith2001Origins.

TO angels

The presence of angels as lesser divine beings is an important distinction within monotheism.

Frequent prophetic plaints in the Bible attest that notwithstanding the law, iconography existed and was common. Specific and significant evidence is found in the vase found at Kuntillet Ajrud which depics <<Yahweh and his asherah >>. See commentary in {B}R/Smith2001Origins. See also Buccellati chapter 15.4.
