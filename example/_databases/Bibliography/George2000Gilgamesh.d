TO Epic of Gilgamesh

This book offers a new, recent English translation of the [**Epic of Gilgamesh**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Epic-of-Gilgamesh), including both Akkadian and Sumerian versions (for the latter, see also texts 1.8.1.1 and followings on [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1*#)). In two *appendices*, the author discusses the methodology he applied in translating the texts from the original tablets (Appendix 1, pp. 209-221) and offers a complete and updated (up until 2000) list of other editions of the same Epic (Appendix 2, pp. 226-228).

[For a wider translation of the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, including also the transliteration of the Akkadian text and the facsimile of the cuneiform tablets, cf. {B}Mes-rel/George2003Gilgamesh.]
