This article begins by giving a brief explanation by Biblical scholar Yehezkel Kauffmann, who argues that the priestly cult and the activities carried out within the <<temple>> were done so in silence and totally devoid of verbalized spells or prayer. He suggests that all activities which were not carried out in <<silence>> happened outside the vicinity of the temple, and that <<psalmody>> was the creation of popular poets and singers who joined the Levite class; the <<psalms>> themselves were not part of any <<sacrificial cult>> or <<priestly rites>>. In response, Knohl utilizes examples from the <<Second Temple period>> that contradict the narrative of temples as <<<sanctuaries of silence>>>. In analyzing the religious attitudes behind the priestly class of the early Torah, Knohl reveals the development of a religious language that negates all previous pagan ideologies of the absolute. He suggests that priestly traditions are not mutually exclusive with any covenantal agreements, that they exist solely as reactionary to pagan customs. Knohl examines cultic acts in detail, searching for specific contexts wherein voice and prayer were permitted or deemed obligatory, noting discrepancies between what was considered pious yet non-compulsory to the citizen of <<Israel>>. Likening allegories to angels as silent servants of the divine, the expectation of silence was mirrored in the temple cults and dictated by the <<Qumran sect>>. After the destruction of the Second Temple, <<silent prayer>> became the religious imperative as a substitute for institutionalized worship.

TO prayer; ritual; temple cults

Buccellati outlines the structural differences between Mesopotamian <<ritual activity>> and <<spontaneous prayer>> as it exists in the biblical tradition. Knohl also stresses the fundamental differences between prayer - especially as an act of silence - and the ritual nature of temple rites.

TO silence; prayer; stillness

Buccellati's mentioning of the story of <<Elijah's ascent to Mount Horeb>> provides another dimension to Knohl's argument, likening Yahweh to "the voice of a subtle silence" reinforces Knohl's argument that silence was considered a divine attribute and was vigilantly practiced in temples. The recurring theme of the mystical aspect of <<asceticism>>; that God can be found in the most remote places (which are presumably silent), further illustrates the importance attached to silent religious activity.
