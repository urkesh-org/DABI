In the opening paragraph of this article, F. Rochberg offers a synthetic yet significant overview on the application of the idea of "science" to Mesopotamian divination by scholars across time. She highlights how «Because the diverse systems of Mesopotamian divination all stemmed from a belief in the gods' involvement in the physical, as well as the social worlds, and because of the close relationship of divination to apotropaic ritual magic, the body of knowledge represented by the omen texts has not always been classified as science, particularly by historians of science who prefer to see in this material a form of pre- or proto-science.» (p. 560)

Rochberg's purpose, however, is to ascertain the criteria of observation implied by omen texts in order to evaluate the "empirical" nature of Mesopotamian divination. In order to do so, she assess an important methodological approach (which is very similar to the one advocated by Buccellati): modern scholars must «strive not to distort ancient systems of thought by the imposition of our own definitions and criteria and may try to determine the content, aims, and methods of such systems "from within". (...) Though our classification of Mesopotamian divination as "science" probably would make no sense to a Babylonian, it serves to make comprehensible to us some aspects of this ancient intellectual tradition by connoting a number of features: among them, empiricism and systematization of knowledge.» (p. 561)
