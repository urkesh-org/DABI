TO namburbi (Akkadian); Appendix 13

This book collects many Akkadian ***namburbi***(http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8207) texts, specific rituals and incantations aiming at averting the action of malefic or evil entities.

Some of these texts are mentioned by G. Buccellati in his book on Mesopotamian religion, specifically in [*Appendix 13*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/appendices_mDP.htm#13).  

[The book is listed in this bibliography because it is used as the basic reference to *namburbi*(http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8207) texts.]
