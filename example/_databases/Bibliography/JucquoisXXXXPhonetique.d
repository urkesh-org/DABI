Jucquois states in his preface 'Le but auquel r&#233;pond ce travail est l'&#233;tude comparative de la phon&#233;tique des dialects moyen-babyloniens du nord et de l'ouest, c'&#233;st—&#224;—dite des textes &#233;crits du XVI au XI si&#232;cle avant notre &#232;re, dans les r&#233;gions sises au nord de l'Assyrie ou &#224; l'ouest de la M&#233;sopotamie.' As a whole these texts have not been studied from a phonetic viewpoint. Problems exist in the writing system, and in the fact that "L'akkadien n'&#233;tait vraisemblablement pas la langue v&#233;hiculaire des sites &#233;tudi&#233;s ici"; this Akkadian served as the language of international relations, and also of law and of commerce. The work is approximately organized as follows; INTRODUCTIONS 1) lists of documents studied, listed by point of origin and point of discovery; 2) problems of the writing system; 3) the various syllabaries in use; 4) discussion of the idea of 'faute'. PREMI&#200;RE PARTIE—VOCALISME DEUXI&#200;ME PARTIE—CONSONANTISME. These two parts, the bulk of the work, are extended and exhaustive studies on the various phonetic changes occuring in these dialects, with a detailed break-down of the changes dialect by dialect. Jucquois likes to take one specific morpheme and analyze its reflexes in the dialects quite thoroughly. CONCLUSIONS GENERALES; especially useful is a list of influences working on MB, organized by influencing language or dialect, and some general marks on the dialects studied here. The appendix contains a concordance of the principal sign-lists; in the INTRODUCTIONS is a sign list showing in wtat area each value is attested.
