TO Divine wrath; Warrior god

This article investigates different manifestations of the **divine wrath** in the Hebrew Bible. **God’s anger seems to be at the origin of his name**, according to Wellhausen, deriving this conclusion from the root “h-w-h”. It would be fitting, then, that a god of the tempest would be named Yhwh.

The wrath is an attribute of the **warrior god**, and Yhwh is often depicted in this function. But Yhwh’s wrath is also directed against his own people. This is the case in the book of Job and 2 Sam 24. Here Yhwh’s wrath appears arbitrary and incomprehensible. For that reason later redactors have interpreted this manifestation of divine anger through the figure of **Satan**. See {B}R/Hamidovic2015Mastema.

In the deuteronomistic ideology, Yhwh’s wrath is the ‘logical’ consequence of the people’s and their king’s misconduct. Yhwh’s wrath manifests itself in the destruction of Jerusalem. It is important as a sort of **theodicy** which indicates that **Yhwh was not beaten by the gods of the Babylonians**, but rather was himself the origin of the disaster that befell Israel.

This theology of retribution raises the question whether Yhwh’s wrath can be suspended or whether he can change his mind, and this issue is reflected in the re-reading of the prophets after the destruction of Jerusalem.

The book of Jonah gives an ambiguous answer to this question. On one hand, it would seem to suggest the **universalism of faith in Yhwh**, and God’s mercy. But the reader in the third century BCE would know that Ninevah was in fact destroyed: so perhaps the message is that **repentance does not mean that one can escape the consequences of one’s actions**. R&ouml;mer concludes, <<Yhwh can change his mind, but not definitively.>> (p. 324)
