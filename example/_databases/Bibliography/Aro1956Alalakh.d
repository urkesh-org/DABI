TO Mittani; Nuzi; Alalakh; subjunctive; preterite

A survey of data with the general conclusion that Alalakh Akadian is substantially a form of Mitanni Akk. (i. e., as in Nuzi), though somewhat more archaic and more influenced by NWSem; the peculiarities of Mittani Akk. seem to derive from development within Babylonian rather than from influence of Assyrian (even though geographically closer). Some of the traits of Alalakh (and Mittani are the confusion of voiced, voiceless emphatic stops, accusative suffixes like *-&#353;un&#363;* instead of *-&#353;un&#363;ti*, use of the generalizing suffix *-me*, more frequent use of *u* and *-ma u*, frequent omission of the subjunctive normal use ofthe preterite (over the perfect) to express past tense.
