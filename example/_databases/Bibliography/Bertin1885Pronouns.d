Gives first an outline of all forms of the personal pronoun, independent and suffix, including also the dative; then an outline of the Agau and Galla pronouns (72-77), stressing the resemblances (in line with an early Hamito- Semitic comparativism); finally an outline of "akkadian" (i.e. Sumerian, thus on pp. 65, 81) pronouns, as deduced especially from a grammatical tablet published in conunction with the article (78-88). [Cf. BEZOLD 1919s Verbalsuffixformen].
