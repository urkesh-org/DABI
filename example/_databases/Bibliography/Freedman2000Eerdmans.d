TO dictionary of the Bible

This volume collects in alphabetical order many entries describing terms (personal names, toponyms, etc.), concepts, and historical events attested in the Bible (both Old and New testament). The entries are enriched with many references to biblical passages, better illustrating the lemma discussed in this dictionary. After each lemma, a short bibliographical reference is offered.
