TO Babylonian wisdom

The author discusses and recontextualises in this contribution the very definition of **Wisdom literature** in ancient Mesopotamia, also considering ancient Sumerian and Akkadian (and also Hebrew) terms which could be translated as ‘wisdom (literature)’. Throughout the analysis of some of the most important literary compositions on this theme (such as the *Ludlul bēl nēmeqi*, passages from the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, the so-called *Babylonian Theodicy*, and also prayers, hymns, invocations, and rituals). 

[This contribution, published in the volume {B}R/Clifford2007Wisdom, helps in re-defining the very concept of ‘wisdom literature’ according to ancient Mesopotamian background and mindset, by applying a kind of -emic approach to the analysis of ancient literary sources.]
