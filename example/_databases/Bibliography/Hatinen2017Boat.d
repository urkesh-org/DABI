The aim of the present article is to contextualise the boat metaphors used in Mesopotamian literary expression through a survey of the pertinent sources, covering a time frame of roughly 2000 years. The author's ultimate goal is to understand the semantic relationship that was understood by the people using the metaphor of the pregnant woman and the fully laden boat, and by those who heard it. The first part of the article focuses on the cargo of the boat, i.e. the unborn child that the woman carries in her womb. In the second part, the boat itself is investigated in the light of Mesopotamian metaphors or similes.
The article offers an **overall coherent understanding of the boat metaphor and its relation to the pregnant woman or childbirth**: firstly, it recalls the literary tradition according to which the pregnant woman was similar to a vessel carrying a cargo of precious items (that represented the unborn baby) - typically aromatics, cedar, carnelian and lapis lazuli. Then, the author also highlights that numerous uses of the boat metaphor in literary figurative language were not restricted to the specific case of a pregnant woman, but they could also be applied to all humans. Thus, the difficulties experienced by a boat were a metaphor for difficulties in a person's life. Bringing this image to the extreme consequences, the image of the sinking of a boat existed as a euphemistic expression for death. Consequently, the sinking of a boat filled with goods came to identify the death of a pregnant woman.
