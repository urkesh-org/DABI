<<**Shuilas** are liturgical **ritual-prayers** that were directed to the high deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon such as Marduk, Shamash, and Ishtar, among others. A ritual official (i.e., an exorcist) recited these prayers to assist a troubled client, often a Babylonian or Assyrian king. The exorcist would read the prayer aloud and the (presumably illiterate) client would repeat the words after him. […] The present project is working tentatively with a catalog of slightly more texts, 137 prayers. The number of tablet manuscripts that bear witness to these prayers is more than twice as large—the project’s on-going catalog contains over 300 tablets—because many prayers are represented on several copies from different ancient libraries. But it is difficult to know how accurate this is since there are still many unpublished and/or uncataloged tablets and even some unpublished catalogs of tablets. This state of affairs has unfortunate results for scholars wishing to consult these prayers. For example, many unpublished textual witnesses fill gaps in otherwise incomplete prayers or present alternative readings. Often only a few specialists know about these tablets. A new edition of all shuila-prayers is therefore a pressing desiderata in Assyriology>> (from website).
