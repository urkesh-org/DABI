This long and detailed article proposes to investigate the topics of **servility and servile systems in Babylonia** as an aggregate phenomenon, to be analyzse on a large scale with both quantitative and qualitative methods. At first, it offers an overview of previous Assyriological studies and theories that had been applied to study the servile people of Mesopotamia, and then it highlights the additional hurdles encountered by those who aim to study servile population on the basis of Babylonia’s written record (issues connected to translation, identification, documentary continuity, and historical characterization). Ultimately, Tenney comes to the conclusion that «the origins of servile systems in Babylonia can be explained with the Nieboer-Domar hypothesis, which proposes that large-scale systems of bondage will arise in regions with plentiful land but few workers. Once established, these systems persisted and were reinforced through Babylonia’s high balance mortality, political ideologies, economic incentives, and social structures.» (pp. 715-716).
In §11 (esp at pp. 762-763), Tenney investigates in particular the concept of ***dullum***, to demonstrate that servility in all of its manifestations was embraced and codified by the monarch or those writing on his behalf. He quotes examples taken from the literary poems of *Atrahasis*, *Enuma Eliš*, and *The Toil of Babylon*, in which it is stated that the roles of mankind are to
perform the work of the state and provide for the gods. The term *dullum* that appears in these texts is translated as “forced labor” or “corvée”, to encompass a range of meanings. «In Atrahasis, *dullu* describes the tasks that the inferior Igigi gods were forced to perform for the seven Anunnaki gods, and the fulfillment of these obligations was transferred to mankind after their creation. By extension, one could argue that because these texts were allegories for an ideal Babylonia, the imposition of work on the less powerful was explicitly known to maintain the position of elites, whether they be gods or men.» (p. 763).
