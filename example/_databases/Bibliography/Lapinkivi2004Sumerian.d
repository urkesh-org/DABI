TO sacred marriage

<<The primary purpose of this study is to increase understanding of **Sumerian sacred marriage** by approaching it from a **comparative perspective**. More generally, it is hoped that the study will illustrate the fruitfulness of the comparative approach for the study of Sumerian religion and royal ideology and that it will prove useful to the other fields of study whose sources were used as the comparative evidence.
The comparative evidence includes sources from six different fields of study: Assyriology (first and second millennium love lyrics and rituals), Biblical studies (The Song of Songs), Classics (Graeco-Roman philosophies, Chaldean Oracles), Gnostic studies, Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) and Indology (Hindu rites and myths). Ancient Egyptian and Ugaritic evidence is also used>> (from author’s description of the book on [editor’s webpage](https://www.eisenbrauns.org/books/titles/978-951-45-9058-0.html)).

[This volume collects a series of Sumerian rituals connected to the ceremony of the **sacred marriage**, offering comparisons with other Mesopotamian attestations of the same religious performance.]
