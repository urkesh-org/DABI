TO Israel tribal league; song of the sea; song of Deborah

This article proposes a **dating for the Song of the Sea (Ex 15) and the Song of Deborah (Judg 5)**. Freedman proposes that the former should be assigned to about 1175 BCE, and the latter to about 1125.
One important piece of information that leads to this dating is the coexistence of the four peoples mentioned in Ex. 15:14-15. The Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Canaanites coexisted only during the 12<sup>th</sup> century BCE. (The apparent contradiction with the Marniptah victory stele can be resolved by proposing, as Freedman does, that a political unit called Israel already existed in Syria-Palestine, but had neither attained statehood nor adopted Yahwism.)

Thus **Freedman conjectures that the group referred to in the Song of the Sea brought Yahwism to the northern territory** and later became an integral part of that political and tribal group. This conclusion is supported by the lack of any mention of conquest of Canaan and no mention of the patriarchs or a promised land: "there is no obvious link between Yahweh and the God of the Fathers." (p. 11) In Freedman's view, the Egyptian slaves were an "undefined mixture of stateless people" who secured a unique leader, and emerged as the "people of Yahweh". Later, they would become part of Israel, as the Song of Deborah suggests.

The Song of Deborah (Judg 5) celebrates the victory in battle at the Kishon river. It contains a list of ten tribes, lacking Judah, Simeon, and Levi, which Freedman interprets to mean that "Israel" was in the twelfth century a confederation of ten tribes. The complete 12 tribe lists are to be dated later: "It is my contention that an original twelve-tribe league in Canaan bore the name Israel, and included Simeon, Levi, and the ten tribes mentioned in the Song of Deborah, but not Judah, which had a separate history. The two tribes, Simeon and Levi, were dropped from membership, and the remaining ten-tribe group, pictured in the Song of Deborah, constituted the Israelite federation in the twelfth and early part of the eleventh century B.C. It is possible that efforts were made to reconstitute a twelve-tribe league including Judah and Simeon during the eleventh century under the leadership of Samuel, but clear evidence is lacking. Out of this league, the monarchy emerged, with Saul as the first king (*melek*) or dynastic ruler (*nagid*) of Israel. A similar development took place in the south with David becoming king of Judah, apparently before the death of Saul. After the death of Ishbaal, under David's forceful leadership the two kingdoms were united, only to fall apart again after the death of his son Solomon." (p. 17)
