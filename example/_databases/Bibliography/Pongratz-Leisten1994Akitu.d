The volume aims to analyse the topography of the city in first-millennium BCE Mesopotamia of the first millennium, in the light - and in function of - the main rituals of the time, which were carried out also due to their being often representations of mythological events. The author examines with particular accuracy the documentation related to the akitu festival, not only because it is the most documented event, but also because it is the richest in mythical content. The author's examination is constantly conducted with reference to both the Babylonian and Assyrian cultures: differentiations linked to the specific political-religious background of the two geographical areas are duly highlighted.

The scholar begins by outlining the city space in Mesopotamia, on an ideal and symbolic level, with reference to cosmogonic myths (in particular, the Enuma Elish): the city is clearly represented as a place of order, as opposed to the steppe which is instead the place of chaos. Within the city, each symbolic place is also clearly defined. The scholar then examines the sequence and significance of the various processional stations that took place during the akitu festival.

Overall, Pongratz-Leisten interprets the akitu as a symbolic re-enactment of the moment preceding the establishment of Marduk's royalty. To support and confirm this interpretation, she proposes a specific analysis of the mythical contents of Enuma Elish, a poem in which one finds two different mythologies intertwined and merged in the same context: the struggle for divine succession and the creation of the cosmos.

As far as the role of the sovereign within the New Year's Festival is concerned, the scholar, based on the available sources, observes how in Babylon the king mostly remains in the background, while priests played the predominant role of ritual actions. In Assyria, instead, the ruler represents the central figure who attracts the greatest prestige precisely on the ritual level.

The volume is enriched by a vast collection of epigraphic material, which gathers many sources of different genres, and by a rich topographical documentation which helps the reader following the discussion throughout the book.
