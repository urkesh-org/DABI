TO myths; politics and religion

The author discusses in this publication the nature and features of **myths** in Ancient Near Eastern mindset (under an historical perspective), together with the relationship of these texts to **politics**, and their deliberate use to strengthen the power of the king or, more in general, the connection between the gods and the king (gods’ representative on earth).
