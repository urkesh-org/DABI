The infinitive with ending *-i* followed by a subject constitutes a
complete sentence in the Akkadian of the West, of the type *qat&#257;li(-ma)
an&#257;ku* "I am/was (engaged) in killing" i.e. "I kill(ed)"; the enclitic *-ma* is optional, but frequent. Such
use of the infinitive is found else where in West Semitic, and is a Canaanitism in West Akk.; the
ending *i* is possibly related in function to the use of *-&#363;m* with the
absolute infinitive in Akk.
