<<It is common knowledge that the **phenomenon called “prophecy”** -- transmission of allegedly divine messages by a human intermediary to a third party -- is well attested, not only in the Hebrew Bible, but also in a number of ancient Near Eastern sources from different times and places. […] The seven contributions collected in this volume are published to provide all readers with recent information about the poorly known
sources of ancient Near Eastern prophecy, and to open new vistas of research for specialists -- cuneiformists as well as scholars in biblical and religious studies. […] The temporal and geographical distribution of the sources examined in this book ranges from Mari of the eighteenth century B.C.E., to the Hebrew Bible, to Assyria of the seventh century B.C.E., and to Arabian documents from the seventh century C.E. The articles are written from manifold perspectives, including methodological, socioreligious, anthropological, as well as historical viewpoints>> (from *Preface*, p. vii).  

[The volume describes within a comparative approach the phaenomenon of prophetism in a diachronic and synchronic perspective, underlining similarities and differences between different periods or cultures.]
