One of the most characteristic structures at Urkesh is indeed represented by the underground **necromantic pit** called *ābi* [see [Urkesh website](http://urkesh.org/MZ/A/A12/UGR/-frame.htm)].

This paper investigates in detail the possible function of such a structure, discovered in the 1999 campaign in [**Area A12**](http://urkesh.org/pages/89-A12.htm) of the [**Royal Palace**](http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm) and provisionally labelled as [***underground structure W***](http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm), dated between 2300 BC and 2100 BC. 

After a general introduction to the topic, *paragraph 2* describes the structure itself, its architecture (the rounded chamber, the squared room and the nature of the accumulations within the pit) and the major finds (most noteworthy, the **anthropomorphic vessel** [A12.108](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/CERAMICS/texts/C3/D/A12.0108.htm) (cf. [Buccellati and Kelly-Buccellati 2001](http://urkesh.org/attach/Buccellati%202001%20Uberlegungen.pdf)), the inscribed sealing [A12.82](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/XVW/UNIT-TN/A12-i.htm) (see pictures under item’s no.) and animal bones (see [Di Martino 2005](http://urkesh.org/attach/Di%20Martino%202005.pdf) for the analysis of **faunal remains**).

*Paragraph 3* faces the challenge of **interpretation**, understanding the structure on the base of ancient written sources (mostly Hurrian and Hittite texts, quoting the term **<sup>(d)</sup>*ābi* **) and archaeological comparisons with similar structures (interpreted as **KASKAL.KUR**) at Ḫattuša and (possibly) at Yazılıkaya.

*Paragraph 4* further strengths the interpretation of the structure as a **Hurrian *ābi***, describing the possible **nocturnal rituals** that could take place within the pit. 

*Paragraph 5* investigates the **historical meaning of the rituals** performed in the *ābi*: **necromantic practices** are attested in Mesopotamian and Anatolian sources (and in the Bible, too) and similar cultic activities were acted in the area of the *ābi* (also including the mudbrick platform in Area X, for which see e.g. [Buccellati 2005](http://urkesh.org/EL-MZ/Buccellati_2005_Monumental_Urban_Complex_-_SCCNH_15.pdf)) to worship **chthonian deities**: thus, the **triple equation Area A12 = *ābi* = KASKAL.KUR**, as a **passage to the Netherworld** seems to be validated by both textual and archaeological evidence.

TO necromancy; ābi

Archaeological evidence for Syro-Mesopotamian necromantic practices are attested at [Urkesh/Tell Mozan](http://urkesh.org/) in the underground necromantic pit (previously labelled as A12) known as  [*ābi*](http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm) (a Hurrian word); this structure reminds the Biblical *ô´b* (see [*1 Sam.* 28,7]( https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=28&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls)). For an in-depth description of this structure, see {B}R/KellyBuccellati2002Unterwelt.
