Written when Buber was 45, *I and Thou* explores human existence through the lens of three nouns, I, it, and Thou, which in Buber's view form **two essential kinds of relationships**. Buber asserts that the <<I – it>> relationship pertains to the world of things, techniques, power, objectivity, and the <<I – Thou>> relationship pertains to the world of persons. <<The primary word I – Thou can only be spoken with the whole being. The primary word I – it can never be spoken with the whole being.>> (p. 3)
Human life is twofold, and Buber clarifies that he does not mean to disparage the objective, <<I – it>> relationships that make up much of the life and activity of humans. But the <<I>> in relation to objects is not the same as the <<I>> that relates to persons. <<When Thou is spoken, the speaker has no thing for his object.>> (p. 4) Buber struggles with words in order to present a rich distinction between objects and the <<mysticism of presence>> of the <<Thou>>, and to insist upon the incommensurable value of a person. Famously, he wrote that <<all real living is meeting>>. 
Buber’s prophetic voice is attractive, but it is also limited by its lack of reference to sources and anchoring in history. It is a personal theory: interesting, sometimes poetically beautiful, sometimes penetrating in its description of the way we live. For a more in-depth analysis, see <a href=”https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buber/”>plato.stanford.edu</a>.
There are several points of contact with Buccellati’s thesis commented in the notes.

TO fate; destiny; polytheism; monotheism

Buber and Buccellati present a similar distinction between **polytheism** (= objective, <<It>> relationships) and **monotheism** (= <<Thou>>). Buber writes: <<The present arises only in virtue of the fact that the Thou becomes present. The I of the primary word I-It, that is, the I faced by no Thou, but surrounded by a multitude of ‘contents,’ has no present, only the past.>> (p. 12) This description of the “I-It” relationship is similar to Buccellati’s description of a polytheistic relationship with fate. Buccellati asserts, for instance, that **fate** or destiny is <<not a subject that acts, nor the counterpart in a personal relationship. It is instead just an inert object, which exists as the presupposition upon which one depends and with which one deals.>> (*When* 5.3)



@NOTES R/7.3

TO transcendence; absolute; faith

The <<I-Thou>> relation happens in the present and is <<continually present and enduring>> (p. 13). It is not <<cut off and hardened>>, like objects that can be relegated to the past or to locations in space. It only lives in the present instant. Along similar lines, Buccellati contrasts the <<**diffuse transcendence** proper to polytheism>> with the <<**absolute transcendence** of the one God>>, who is perceived as <<situated above the temporal flux precisely in recognizing that his ‘grace’ (*hen* in Hebrew, which is to say his providential interest in the affairs of the world) remains unchanged in every case, regardless of whatever calamities afflict the social group that recognizes him.>> (*When* 7.3). Buber and Buccellati also agree in their perception of the instability of the <<I-Thou>> relationship. For Buber, <<it is the exalted melancholy of our fate, that every Thou in our world must become an It. … As soon as the relation has been worked out or has been permeated with a means, the Thou becomes an object among objects—perhaps the chief, but still one of them, fixed in its size and its limits.>> (p. 16-17) Man longs for control and extension in time. <<Thus God becomes an object of faith. At first faith, set in time, completes the acts of relation; but gradually it replaces them.>> (p. 113)

TO duality

It is interesting that Buber’s first translator in English, Ronald Gregor Smith, insisted on a progressive movement from an <<old monistic>> manner of thought to the two-fold interpretation of experience that Buber presents. Buber, on the other hand, states that there is no progress, and that the apperception of the Thou is an event that inevitably tends toward a decline into an It relationship. <<Man is twofold>> means that man cannot live only in the utter present of the Thou, but also must live in the world of things. The old Plato vs. Aristotle debate, summarized in Raffael’s *stanze vaticane*, remains an inescapable **duality**.

TO magic; prayer

Buber points out the technical nature of **magic**, as opposed to the personal nature of **prayer**: <<Magic desires to obtain its effects without entering into relation, and practises its tricks in the void. But sacrifice and prayer are set ‘before the Face’, in the consummation of the holy primary word that means mutual action: they speak the Thou, and then they hear.>> (p. 83) See *When*, chapter 13, for Buccellati’s description of magic.


@NOTES R/22.11

TO intuition; prayer; ritual

Buber refers to the fact that in ritual and in codified prayer, the original mystical **intuition** of a divine Thou can be codified and controlled through technique, and priesthood can become a cynical use of smoke and mirrors for the manipulation of simple people. Note however the difference in the biblical origin stories of the rites, in Leviticus for instance: <<The preoccupation with assigning the system a specific origin in time, attributing the source of the rules to divine initiative, and developing the theme of holiness in relation to the articulation of the rites—all this indicates how lively was the sense that the meaning and value of the [cultic] practices was not exhausted in technique, but was rather intrinsic to the original motivation to be in relation with the absolute and to propose concrete ways in which that could come about.>> (*When* 22.11)

@NOTES R/24.3

TO polytheism; modernity

Buber writes: <<The might of karma or of the stars no longer controls inevitably the lot of man; many powers claim the mastery, but rightly considered most of our contemporaries believe in a mixture of them, just as the late Romans believed in a mixture of gods.>> (p. 56) Buccellati also points out the polytheistic undercurrents in the ostensibly Christian West.
