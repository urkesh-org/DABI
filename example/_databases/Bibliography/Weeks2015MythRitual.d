By discussing several examples where a ritual has a clear connection to a myth from the ancient Near East, the author aims to emphasize that the connection of myth and ritual varied within different cultures and periods. Additionally, the author highlights how very often myths involved in rituals are different from the myths known from the literary tradition, thus making it difficult for a modern reader to understand the separate functions for the literary tradition and whatever tradition lay behind ritual texts.

Weeks first investigates a group of texts in which he can identify with a good degree of certainty such connection of myth and ritual: the Sumerian Sacred Marriage ceremony; a number of Akkadian incantations; Assyrian Cult Commentaries; Egyptian rituals generally; the Hittite myths of the absent god; the festivals of Passover and Booths in the Hebrew Bible. Then, he discusses two instances which he finds more uncertain and controversial: the Babylonian New Year Festival (with its connection to the *Enuma Eliš*) and the Hittite *purulli* festival (and the Myth of Iluyanka).

The Babylonian New Year Festival is discussed at pp. 103-105. Weeks highlights how the fact that *Enuma Eliš* was recited before the god early in the festival is indeed a ritual description, but nowhere in the texts do we find an explanation for such recitation. Rather than considering the acts performed in the festivals as a re-enactment of the story narrated in the myth, Weeks proposes to see the events narrated in the myth as a justification for the ritual itself. «The conclusion to *Enuma Eliš*, and therefore arguably the purpose and point of the story, is the building of Marduk’s temple. One might also argue that the proclamation of Marduk as king of the gods is a close second as the climax of the story. It is conceivable therefore that these elements of the story act as the justification of the following ritual. Marduk’s role as the king of the gods, receiving the other deities in his temple for the determining of the fates, is thus justified by the story but there is no necessity that the ritual acts out the story.» (p. 105).
