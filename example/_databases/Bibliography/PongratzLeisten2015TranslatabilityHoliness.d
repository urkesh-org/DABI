TO holiness

The author's reflection arises from the question of whether the notion of the 'holy' is an adequate concept to apply to ancient Near Eastern religions, their world view and their cult. Pongratz-Leisten also reflects upon the issue of the 'translatability of cultures': at first, she surveys some examples of former Biblical and ancient Near Eastern scholarship on the topic of her interest - then, she focuses on the Sumerian lexicon to show how the perception of the 'temple' changed over time, in the history of Mesopotamia.

Interestingly, the author takes into consideration the Biblical studies (pp. 409-411), analysing how they dealt with the topics of cult and holiness in a comparative perspective with the Mesopotamian studies (412-416) and with frequent and relevant references to anthropological studies.

In the second part of the article, Pongratz-Leisten presents a detailed analysis of the Sumerian and Akkadian terminology used to qualify the Mesopotamian temple, its building materials and its segregation from the 'external world' by means of purification rites and extispicy. Her aim is to investigate what defines the isolated and sacred quality of the temple and which lexicon was used to denote this peculiar status in Sumerian and Akkadian written sources.
