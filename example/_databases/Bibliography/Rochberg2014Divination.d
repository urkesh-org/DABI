<<This paper views the relevance of cuneiform texts to the **history of science** from inside, i.e., from the perspective of the available sources, as well as from outside, i.e., from the perspective of historians of science outside the field of Assyriology. It reviews some of the methodological problems that beset the reconstruction of science in the ancient Near East as well as a way forward, which acknowledges localism and pluralism as well the compelling continuity from cuneiform traditions of knowledge to later counterparts **(astronomy, astrology, magic, astral-medicine**). Cuneiform texts will not instantiate a universal or transcultural science but are essential if science is to be seen as embedded in culture and history>> (author’s abstract on [publisher’s webpage]( https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/janeh/1/1/article-p37.xml?tab_body=abstract).

[The author discusses about the existence of a ‘scientific thought’ in ancient Mesopotamia, revealed by many texts of different ‘genres’.]
