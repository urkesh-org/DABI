The tense system in Semitic is at least a three-way, not a two-way system. In Proto-Semitic next to the stative *gatVI* there is the preterite *yaqtul* from which two other forms are derived by means of vocalic addition in final (*yaqtul-u*) or in medial position with special stress (*yaq-at-tal*). This explains the non-preterital use of the preterite in conditional sentences, the desiderative, the coincidence case (*attarad* "I send hereby"), as well as the non-presential use of the present for incomplete and repeated past action. The Akk. perfect is a secondary innovation.
