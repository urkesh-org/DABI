TO Qoelet; Dialogue between the Master and his Servant

The paper offers a comparison between the book of **Qohelet** and the Mesopotamian ***Dialogue between the Master and his Servant***, underlining the use of humor in both the texts to convey wisdom instruction and moral teachings.
 
[The contribution illustrates how a comparative approach in the analysis of biblical and Mesopotamian compositions can shed more light on the way ancient sages transmitted wisdom through their texts.]
