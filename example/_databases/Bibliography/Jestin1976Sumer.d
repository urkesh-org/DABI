*Chapter 3* of the volume {B}R/Puech1976Storia (by Raymond Jestin) displays the basic concepts of **Sumerian religion**, dealing with the actual perception of religion in historical times, the pantheon, clergy, cults and ceremonies, mythology, prayer, and magic.

Firstly, the author expresses a *caveat*, since a precise definition of **‘religion’** in Sumerian culture is very difficult to be established, because of the lack of any structured text explaining the very concept and perception of religion at Sumer. An attempt in understanding can be grasped only by the analysis of archaeological remains and actual texts reporting hymns, prayers, and myths, at most.

The author bases his analysis on a precise **methodology**: since the Sumerian culture is so far from our modern mindset about religion (i.e., we deal with a [*broken tradition*](https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm)), the only way for scholars consists in enucleating some basic concept throughout the extant texts.

Specifically, the author describes the Sumerian notion of **Afterlife** as something not so well defined but anyhow based on the fundamental concept of **‘fate/destiny’**. 

The religious experience of the Sumerians, is basically structured on the definition of a **cosmic order**, created at the beginning of the world, which must be observed and respected to reconnect the human sphere to that of the gods.

The concrete expressions of Sumerian **religious thought** is outlined in the **pantheon**, the hierarchic structure of the **clergy**, and the regulation of specific **cultic activities**. What can be understood is that the Sumerian religion was basically addressed to the observation of specific ritual activities, festivals, and celebrations, which granted the conservation of the aforementioned **cosmic order**.  


[This contribution helps in tracing the basic concepts of Sumerian religious belief and its actual cultic practice. The contribution places as the fundamental bedrock of Sumerian religion the observance and conservation of the cosmic ‘order’ established by the gods at the creation of the world. This concept of ‘order’, governing both the divine and human behaviour, can be slightly compared to G. Buccellati’s notion of the ‘absolute’ (see specifically *Chapter 1*, *Sections 1-2* and *Chapter 3*, *Section 4*).]

The conception of the **‘absolute’** as a **‘matrix’** can be compared with the Sumerian notion of cosmic ‘order’, established by the gods at the creation of the world; on this topic, see specifically {B}R/Jestin1976Sumer.
