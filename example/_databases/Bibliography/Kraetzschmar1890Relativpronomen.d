A serious study, with good documentationâ€” and a good example of how a thorough
descriptive systematization, however old, may still retain full interest 
and validity, even when the historical reconstruction on which it rests has proven almost 
entirely untenable. The first part is devoted to the pronoun *&#353;a*:
the author claims, through etymology and through a description of the
usage, that it is demonstrative in origin; then clarifies its function
to indicate the owner or the like [=determinative] , and as a nota
genitivi; finally suggests that in some cases it behaves like a real
preposition. The second part investigates clauses governed by *&#353;a*,
which retains even in this environment a demonstrative character.
First, he studies the component elements of the relative clause: resumptive pronoun (with precise rules as to its occurrence or non-occurrence), the subjunctive in *-u* (here defined clearly for the first 
time, and distinguished from the forms in *-a*, which are considered
euphonic or emphatic, esp. p. 412 f.), presence or absence of a head
noun from which the clause depends, deletion of the relative pronoun.
The author then goes on to study the different types of clauses from
a notional point of view, i.e. subjective, objective, temporal, final,
comparative, causal sentences; here he considers not only relatives
in the strict sense, but also subordinates governed by conjunctions.
