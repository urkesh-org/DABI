<<This book is a history of religious life in the Ancient Near East, from the beginnings of agriculture to Alexander the Great’s invasion in the 300s BCE. Daniel C. Snell traces key developments in the history, daily life, and religious beliefs of the people of Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, and Iran. His research investigates the influence of those ideas on the West, with particular emphasis on how religious ideas from this historical and cultural milieu continue to influence the way modern cultures and religions view the world. 
Designed to be accessible to students and readers with no prior knowledge of the period, this book uses fictional vignettes to add interest to its material, which is based on careful study of archaeological remains and preserved texts. This book provides a thoughtful summary of the Ancient Near East and includes a comprehensive bibliography to guide readers in further studies of related topics>> (book presentation).

The book develops through 17 chapters investigating religious beliefs on ancient Near East, from Egypt to Iran, with an overview on later periods (Greece, Etruria, and Rome).

*Chapter 1* defines the chronological and geographical framework of the book, better also explaining the term **‘Near East’** in the history of the studies on this quite wide area.

*Chapter 2* investigates the **‘early inklings’** of the development of a religious thought in the area, starting from the Neolithic site of [**Çatalhöyük**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), in Konya Plain (Anatolia) (cf. entry: {B}Mes-rel/Hodder2010Emergence), moving to Bronze-Age Mesopotamia, describing some glimpses on Sumerian and Akkadian religion.

*Chapter 3* aims to better define the meaning of the term **‘gods’** under a Near Eastern perspective, explaining their conception and purposes in human life, and the different kinds (or ‘hierarchy’) of gods, (polyad gods, personal gods, and demons).

*Chapter 4* describes the relationship between **cities, States, and gods**, investigating how gods acted several times in helping the power to amalgamate cities and to forge empires, with a focus on Ur III piety and temple-centred administration, on later Old Babylonian decentralization, until reaching also the Hittite empire.

*Chapter 5* is entirely focused on **Egypt** (between 4000 and 1400 BC), displaying the birth of religious thoughts, art, and architecture, mostly as a manifestation of the pharaonic power and sovereignty on the entire world (the pharaoh being an actual god on earth).

*Chapter 6* discusses about the many gods of Egypt and the **Egyptian polytheism** in general.

*Chapter 7* moves to analyse the **Amarna period** (ca. 1350-1300 BC and the establishment by Akhenaten of the first ‘monotheism’ (or maybe better ‘henotheism’).

*Chapter 8* presents religious practices in Egypt, mostly focusing of the **embalming rituals** and the afterlife beliefs and defence against evils (both in life and afterlife).     

*Chapter 9* focuses on the so-called **‘International Age’** (ca. 1400-1000 BC), when the contacts between the different entities of ancient Near East strongly interacted with Egypt and the Mediterranean world in general; the author devotes a paragraph to the [**Epic of Gilgamesh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh), which spread from Ur III period onwards;

*Chapter 10* describes the relationship between gods and people, under the different forms of enquiry on personal **fate** (Sumerian **NAM-TAR**; Akkadian **šimtu**), **divine decrees**, **divination**, and **exorcism**.

*Chapter 11* discloses the development of **monotheism** in **Israel**, connecting the Israelite religion to Egypt and Babylon.

*Chapter 12* investigates the later religious changes during the so-called [**‘Axial Age’**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age) (ca. 8<sup>th</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> cent. BC), showing how religion thoughts slightly changed during this period in many geographical areas, from the Mediterranean (with Greek [**Pre-Socratics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy) and [**Platonism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism)) to China (with [**Confucius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius) and [**Lao-Tze**](https:*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi), India (with [**Buddha**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha)), and Iran (with [**Zoroaster**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster)); the author further stresses how the Syro-Mesopotamian area was not affected by these changes in mind, developing on the other side a reflection about the problem of the individual, revitalizing and spreading texts about the topic of the **righteous suffering**.

*Chapter 13* insists on the topic of the difference between **good gods** and **bad gods**, as it developed in Zoroastrian religion, later affecting also the dualistic idea (sometimes labelled as heretical) of **good** and **evil** in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

*Chapter 14* moves to **Syria-Palestine**, focusing on the cult of [**Baal**](https:*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal).

*Chapter 15* investigates the various influences of ancient Near Easter religion on **Greece**, **Etruria**, and **Rome**.

*Chapter 16* treats the topic of the **influence** of ancient Near Eastern religious thought on modern religions.

*Chapter 17* tries to reconstruct the actual experience of **religious practices** in ancient Near Eastern religion, linking textual and archaeological evidence concluding that <<we cannot really experience Ancient Near Eastern religion. We can at most imagine. But we should>> (p. 207).

[The volume describes different religions of the antiquity, from the Mediterranean to China, starting from the beginning of the history in the fourth millennium BC, reaching the classic time. The comparative approach presented in this volume is noteworthy because the author tries to identify the influence that Near Eastern religions had on modern religious systems.]

TO religions

An overview on ancient and modern religious systems is presented in {B}R/Snell2010Religions, dealing with different religious beliefs from the fourth millennium BC until the very present. The comparative approach is conducted in a peculiar way, trying to identify the influence of ancient religions on modern beliefs, reaching the conclusion that, because of an evident [*broken tradition*](https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm), it is impossible for modern people to really experience the actual core of ancient religions (<<we cannot really experience Ancient Near Eastern religion. We can at most imagine. But we should>>; p. 207).
