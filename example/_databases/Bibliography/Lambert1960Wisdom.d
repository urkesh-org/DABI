TO Babylonian wisdom

This book presents the English translation of many texts included under the modern label of **“Mesopotamian wisdom literature”**; we speak about ‘modern label’, since the existence in antiquity of a specific ‘wisdom genre’ is currently still debated.

After an *Introduction* and a *Time chart*, the author offers the English translation of the following ‘wisdom text’: “The Poem of the Righteous Sufferer (*Ludlul bēl nēmeqi*)”, the *Babylonian Theodicy”, “Precepts and Admonitions”, “Preceptive Hymns”, *The Dialogue of the Pessimism”, “Fables or Contest Literature”, “Popular Sayings”, and “Proverbs”.

The volume is complemented by critical and philological notes, lists of word discussed and translated tablets, and facsimiles of the cuneiform original texts.
