Though this article does not deal with
Akkadian, it is quoted here as one of the
few examples of structural description of an
ancient Semitic language. The author
chooses the language of Jerusalem at about
600 B.C., and follows "a formal method, which
asks only what forms exist and in what combinations." After a statement of the sources
and of the major historical/phonological changes
before and after 600 B.C., there is a compact
description of the phonemes and their distribution, 
the morphemes and their distribution,
and syntax ("successive inclusive constructions").
