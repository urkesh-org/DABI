TO Sumerian proverbs

<<The importance of proverbs for understanding a people has been long known; as Francis Bacon put it, “The genius, wit and spirit of a nation are discovered in its proverbs.” To quote a modern writer, proverbs “are the safest index to the inner life of a people. With their aid we can construct a mental image of the conditions of existence, the manners, characteristics, morals and Weltanschauung of the community which used them. They present us with the surest data upon which to base our knowledge of Volkspsychologie”>> (from author’s *Introduction*, p. 1).

This paper collects some **Sumerian proverbs** exemplifying the subtle wisdom literature of ancient Mesopotamian people, with a look on Sumerian everyday life or, even more worthy, on their way to interpretate events and behaviours of their daily experience.
