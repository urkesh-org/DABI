<<The first supplementary volume of the series [‘Qatna Studien’](https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/reihe_454.ahtml) presents the contributions of an international symposium held at the University of Tübingen in May 2009. This symposium was initiated and organized by the students and scholars of the post-graduate school ‘Symbols of the Dead’. The topic of the symposium was to evaluate the possibilities in reconstructing Ancient Near Eastern **funerary rituals** from available archaeological and textual evidence. 

Contributors from seven countries discussed many aspects of **ritual behaviour** linked to death, the **after-life** and the variations in ritual treatment of the **deceased** before, during and after the actual burial. 

Among the many issues raised were questions related to the kinds of rituals linked to death in different cultural surroundings, the intentions of the actors conducting such rituals, their meaning and social importance, the question of **ancestors** and **grave goods**, and of grave offerings, the reasons for and the meaning of different burial types, and the theoretical and methodological approaches to ritual. 

Archaeological case studies were introduced, available textual evidence was presented, and even an ethnographic perspective from [Kyrgyzstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan) is contributed. The archaeological and philological sources presented come from a wide geographical framework including Syria and Northern Mesopotamia, the Syro-Anatolian regions, the Southern Levant, Egypt, and Iran. Their chronological frame spans from the third to the first millennium BC. These contributions will enrich our understanding of the various cultural approaches to death in the Ancient Near East and increase our insight into many aspects of **funerary rituals**>> (abstract on [Harrassowitz webpage](https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_1969.ahtml?NKLN=86_B)).

[The contribution is relevant for its approach in the analysis and interpretation of ancient burial customs in ancient Near East and Egypt: starting from archaeological evidence as the ground floor, the author reconstructs the meaning of funerary rituals, grave goods, and ancestor cults on the base of a comparative approach involving ethno-anthropological comparisons.]

TO death; funerary rituals

The interpretation of Ancient Mesopotamian beliefs about death can be helped and supported by the analysis of ancient funerary rituals, involving grave goods and ancestor cults. This topic is widely investigated in {B}Mes-rel/Wissing2012Ritual, where the author approaches this topic from an archaeological and ethno-anthropological perspective.
