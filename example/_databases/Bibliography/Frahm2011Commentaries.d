TO Babylonian and Assyrian text commentaries 

<<This book provides a new introduction to the **text commentaries from Babylonia and Assyria**. It first describes the Mesopotamian philological and divinatory traditions from which the commentaries emerged […], then discusses their temporal and geographic distribution […], and in the following chapters deals with their typology […], hermeneutical techniques […], and sources>> (p. 6)

[The volume illustrates through the analysis of Mesopotamian commentary tablets the way Ancient Babylonians and Assyrians made commentaries to texts of different genres. It is a clear exemplification of how ancient Mesopotamians approached their own literature.]
