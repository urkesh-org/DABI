<<Since the earliest comparative analyses of biblical and Mesopotamian materials, scholars have noted a striking difference between the form of the **Psalter**’s laments of the individual and the Akkadian ***šuilla***-prayers.>> (p. 303).

[The author investigates in this contribution the analogies but mostly the structural differences between the biblical Psalms and the Akkadian *šuilla*-prayers (the so-called ‘hand-lifting prayer’). On this topic, cf. also the online paper: {B}R/Calabro2013Gestures.]
