A collection of data, based mostly on Arabic, Syriac and Ethiopic; the Akk. material (indexed on p. 256 f.), only seldom utilized, is concentrated mostly in a few section, esp. for *&#353;D*> *ID* (194 f.) and then for reduplicated roots (6 f., 24,37,61,74) and for nasalization of long consonant (110 ,147,183,201, 203, 207) [some of the analyses of words being rather questionable]. The organization of the material is according to the single dissimilated sounds and according to environment.
