TO sacred marriage; political legitimation 

<<The sacred marriage ceremony from ancient Mesopotamia is one of the most dramatic ways of conceptualizing the relationship between king and gods known from the ancient world. According to a number of literary texts, kings from the late third and early second millennia -- and perhaps even earlier -- consummated a ritual union with Inanna, the goddess of love and war. Given the literary nature of our evidence, this ceremony may have been only an intellectual construct, rather than an event in real life. Irrespective of this, however, it remains a major source, not only for early Mesopotamian religious thought in general, but for ideas of kingship in particular>> (p. 291).

[The author discusses in this paper the **political role of the sacred marriage ceremony for the legitimation of kingship in ancient Mesopotamia** (as a way of transmission of power from the goddess to the king), presenting the specific example of a hymn, see [ETCSL](https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr2531.htm), of the period of Iddin-Dagan, third king of the dynasty of Isin (ca. 1910-1890 BC, short chronology).]
