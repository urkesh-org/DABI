The Akkadian expression of the type *ina k&#257;r k&#257;r-ma* "in every colony"
is also found in Ugaritic, e.g. *bn&#353;. bn&#353;m* "every man" and possibly
in Amorite: *Ilim-ilim-ma* "of every god"; the particle *-ma* is found,
in the same function and position, as it is in Akkadian even outside
of the case mentioned, e.g. *mamma* ( *&#42;man-ma*) "anyone, " or *immati-ma*
"for every time, forever. " It is assumed that the Akkadian phenomenon is of Amorite origin.
