This forthcoming *Encyclopedia of the Body in Ancient Egypt and the Near East* aims at providing the reader (in electronic version) with the basic textual and iconographic sources related to specific parts of the human body.
 
[This *Encyclopedia* is useful since it will include also the lemma **‘liver’**, explaining its observation by ancient Mesopotamian in **hepatoscopy** and oracular activities.]
