TO manual of sacrificial procedures

The paper presents an Old Babylonian bilingual (Sumerian and Akkadian) text (UCLM-9-1910), kept at the University of California at Berkeley, reporting **instructions for a sacrifice and inspection of liver** of a sheep.  

[The contribution is relevant as an exemplification of sacrificial and divinatory procedures in Ancient Mesopotamia.]
