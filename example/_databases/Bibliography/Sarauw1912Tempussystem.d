Connects Akkadian permansive and WSem. perfect, the permansive being primary in meaning as with the Indo-European perfect; *fa'ila* is the original form, and the use with substantives is secondary. Aorist *yagtul* has, originally, a jussive and preterital function. In the imperfect *ika&#353;&#353;ad* lengthening of middle radical is primary and proto-Se mitic. The equivalent form in Arabic is *yaqtulu*, which is secondary; the *-u*, which in Arabic is a marker of the aspect, became later in Akkadian a marker of mood, and was transferred to the other "tenses,‚Äù In general, it emphasizes the importance of Acadian, though it is *not* considered as linguistically archaic.
