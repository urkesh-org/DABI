Defines briefly the functions of the t-perfect (until then known only through occasional mentions by members of the Landsberger school) and of the t- stems: the perfect in particular, expresses in OB and OA an action just recently concluded, in the later dialects instead any positive statement about past action (386). Follows a list of perfects from t- and tn-stems (where a double t-infix occurs, designated as I/4 etc. in earlier systems), of which the most common are the Bt and Btn perfects. A new stem Btt is deduced for NA because of present and precative forms of the type *uptatarras* (390-93).
