TO Mesopotamian King Lists

<<**Mesopotamian king lists** (KL) exhibit a variety of formats, but their close relationship to texts that have been labeled as ‘chronicles’ makes it difficult to define them as a completely independent form; they have been analyzed together as ‘chronographic texts’>> (author’s abstract on [Wiley Online Library](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah01108)).

[The author tries to better define the nature and typology of Mesopotamian King Lists and the ‘historical’ purposes behind these compositions (cf. on this topic {B}R/Michalowski1983History).]
