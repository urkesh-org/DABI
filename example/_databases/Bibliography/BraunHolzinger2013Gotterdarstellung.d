The scholar presents a study on the **first attested representations of gods** in Mesopotamia. An introduction about cultic statues, cultic symbols and their attributes leading to the identification of specific gods is followed by chapters dedicated to foundation figurines, statuettes, representations of gods in scenes from reliefs and seals. Further chapters deal with early mythology, themes related to vegetation and farming, the role of gods represented on glyptic material, and a general summary on the topics of the horned-crown and denominations of deities. 

[The volume investigates the topic of the first representations of divinities in Mesopotamia, and is strengthened and supported by its approach considering literary sources, archaeological materials, and iconographical elements.]
