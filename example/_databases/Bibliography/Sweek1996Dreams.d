TO divinatory economy; dreams

<<Each society that relies on divination curates an ensemble of means and personnel that comprise a **divinatory economy**. Dreams represent a peculiar means of acquiring divined knowledge in the divinatory economy of the ancient Near East. They may be uninduced phenomena; or they may be induced. They can never be easily credited, for they are not witnessed by any other person than the dreamer. Yet everyone dreams and so can conceive of the dreaming experience of others. And because everyone dreams, each member of the culture stands in a potentially divinatory relationship with his or her society. In this study, I attempt to delineate the political location of divinatory dreams and dreaming in ancient Mesopotamia and Syria-Palestine. First, I discuss the special problems that dreams raise for people in a dream-sharing society. Then, eliciting evidence from documents and literary texts of Mesopotamia, I outline the constructive functions of divinatory dreams and dreaming and the attempts by the divinatory economy to manage the effects of dreams. After having established the parameters with the Mesopotamian evidence, I turn to the biblical literature to ascertain the political location of dreams in the biblical literature>> (author’s abstract).
