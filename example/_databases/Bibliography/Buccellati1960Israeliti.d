TO Israel; exile

The starting point for this contribution is the well-known passage of [*2 Chr.* 36, 20-21](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PBK.HTM), recounting the deportation of the Jews from Jerusalem to Babylonia by [Nebuchadnezzar II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II) in 568 BC.

After having recalled two other Biblical passages relating to the same event (or to the same exile period), i.e. [*Jer.* 37-42](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PQF.HTM), [52](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PQU.HTM), and [*2 Chr.* 36, 20-21](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PBK.HTM), the author summarizes the historical events of that period as they can be reconstructed on a quite stark floor, devoting the whole article to the presentation of the role of the Israelites remained at Jerusalem (or at least in Palestine) during the period of the exile (i.e. from the conquering of Jerusalem by  [Nebuchadnezzar II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II) in 568 BC to the ‘edict of liberation’, as it is inscribed on a [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder) of [Cyrus I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_I) (text in [*ANET*](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/ANET_315-316.pdf)), in 539 BC (for further information see at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity)).

The author sketches out the history of the period as it is narrated in some specific books written in Palestine in the 6<sup>th</sup> cent. BC, i.e. [*Lamentations*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PQV.HTM), and the prophetic books of [*Haggai*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PUK.HTM) and [*Zecharia*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PUN.HTM), telling the events involving the ‘People of the country’ (***‘m h’rṣ***) (cf. for this term {B}R/Buccellati1959BO3).

The author concludes: <<The Lamentations give the testimony of the presence in Palestine (well in Jerusalem) of Israelites profoundly Yahwist and distinct from the group of Godolia: there is therefore reason to think that they remained in Palestine even after the turbulent period of the first months after the capture of Jerusalem and culminated in the killing of Godolia. The books of Haggai and Zechariah testify that the rebuilding of the temple, led by returnees from the exile, was the work of a population in which there is no trace of radical contrast between returnees and those left behind: indeed, from a tenuous but seemingly safe testimony, we can conclude that there was substantially collaboration. Without wondering to draw a direct line between the Israelites of Lamentations and the Palestinian Israelites of the time of Haggai and Zechariah ... it is certain, however, that both groups are part of the same Yahwist tradition that continued on Palestinian land>> (p. 290).
