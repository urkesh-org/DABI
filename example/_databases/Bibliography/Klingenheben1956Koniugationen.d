After summarizing R&#214;SSLER 1950 "Verbalbau," criticizes in detail some of the latter’s conclusions. The lengthening of middle radical in
the imperfect of some Ethiopic languages is secondary, and cannot
serve as evidence for a long middle radical of the Akkadian present,
nor for the proto-Semitic character of this form. The same negative
conclusions are drawn with respect to a comparison of the Akkadian pre
sent with Mehri, Berber and Bedauye forms, and of the Akkadian permansive with Berber, Bedauye and Egyptian forms. The permansive and
present of Akkadian are then explained as being denominative in their
origin, the permansive coming from a nominal sentence with contraction of predicative noun and pronominal subject, the present from
the verbalization of nouns of agent or the like (pp. 248-50).[It
should be noted that no mention of the Akkadian perfect is made as part
of the Akkadian verbal system.] The last section of the article examines the features of the verbal system which should be considered as
proto-Hamito — Semitic: imperative, prefix conjugation, derived stems,
reduplication, u vocalism for the passive. The suffix-conjugation, including the Akkadian permansive, is late, and so are the Akkadian present
and the notion of aspect.
