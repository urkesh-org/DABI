The purpose of this article is to investigate the significance of the calendar and time manipulation in first millennium BC Assyria through the analysis of a variety of written sources, which provide useful information with regard to the perception that the Neo-Assyrian society had of calendrical issues. From such analysis, it may be inferred that not only there was a considerable awareness of the importance of the religious calendar and the observance of festivals in the proper days, but also that the control of timing was so developed that it was even incorporated into the semantics of the royal propaganda. Among the many powers that a Neo-Assyrian king could boast, thus, there was also the one of ruling over time.
At first, the article refers to some specific characteristics of the Assyrian calendar of the first millennium BC, introducing the individuals who were involved in the determination of the days and months and discussing the system that was in use. Then, it discusses how calendrical issues were used in the Neo-Assyrian royal propaganda to convey the idea of a universal central power. Finally, the article presents an updated cultic calendar for the period under investigation.
