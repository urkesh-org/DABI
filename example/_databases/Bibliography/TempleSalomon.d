TO Temple of Salomon

<<In 1883, a biblical scholar […] named Thomas Newberry designed a model, or a small, three-dimensional copy, of an ancient temple in Jerusalem, based on descriptions of its architecture that he found in the Bible. Four years later, the model was featured as the centerpiece of one of these large, public exhibitions: the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition. […] Thanks to the efforts of The Met's Imaging Department […], we can use digital technology to take a peek inside Newberry's model>> (from website).
