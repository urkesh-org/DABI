<<The **prayers of ancient Israel and Mesopotamia** are rare windows into how ancient peoples interacted with their gods. Much work has already been done to describe how social conventions are important driving factors behind these interactions with deities. In order to utilize these observations and further understand the relationships between humans and gods, it is important to understand the ritual environment in which these relationships are created. A performance approach to ritual allows us to properly contextualize the **human-divine relationships** that are attested in prayers within their ritual
environments. In both Israel and Mesopotamia, actions within rituals take place in framed domains; because all social action occurs in framed domains as well, rituals can be profitably compared to other domains, such as theatre or sports. This dissertation uses a performance approach to analyze four different groups of prayers from the first-millennium BCE. Two groups of prayers are from Mesopotamia and are clustered around two rituals: the Akkadian ***šuilla*** and the ***dingiršadabba***. The other two groups of prayers come from the **Book of Psalms**: the **individual and communal laments**>> (from author’s abstract on pp. vi-vii).

[This thesis presents a comparative approach in the analysis of Mesopotamian and Israelite prayer, understood as a personal way to communicate with the divine sphere.]
