The author's stated goal for this book is to investigate Israelite and Mesopotamian penitential prayer (called *šig?* and *dingiršadibba*). In doing this, however, van der Toorn undertakes an investigation of the moral world-view of each culture in which the prayers were recited, using a comparative approach between Israel and Mesopotamia.

In the opening chapter, the scholar provides a broad comparison of the social organization, religious beliefs, and intellectual orientation of the two cultures under investigation, including an introduction on the methodology that he intends to apply and a reflection on the comparative approach itself. Then, he begins his analysis of Israelite and Mesopotamian moral concepts - dividing them into two categories: ethical rules (which refers to the opposition right/wrong) and etiquette (related, instead to proper/improper). van der Toorn however acknowledges that both these categories aim to win the divine favor and remove any possibility of anger and punishment from the god(s).

Following his investigation, the scholar analyzes the concepts of taboo, oath, and curse - always pointing out to similarities and differences between the Biblical and Mesopotamian traditions. Then, he goes on by analyzing the human experience of divine punishment through a variety of written sources (wisdom texts, penitential prayers, medical diagnoses). Overall, van der Toon identifies several major similarities and but a few differences between Israel and Mesopotamia. The main differences which he finds amongst the two is related to the sharp antithesis between "wise" and "fool", "righteous" and "wicked" etc. that he detects frequently in the Hebrew Bible, but not so much in Mesopotamian written sources. His explanation is that such antithesis, originated in the ethos of the Israelite aristocracy, remained in use, with certain changes, even after the aristocracy had been weakened, because it suited well the exclusivistic demands of Israelite religion.
