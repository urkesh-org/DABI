TO Akkadian prayer

After a theoretical discussion about the very concept of prayer in Mesopotamia, the volume collects many **Akkadian prayers and hymns**, of different ‘genres’: *šuilla*-prayers, *namburbi*, dingiršadibba-prayers, eršaḫunga-prayers, *tamitū*-prayers, ‘Gottesbriefe’, royal prayers, and hymns.

[The book represents a useful source for a comparison between Mesopotamian prayers and Biblical texts, specifically with the *Psalter*.]
