In the opening pages of this article, the author presents the forms which characterised, in ancient Mesopotamia, the phaenomenon of "sacred marriage" (that is considered to be «one of the key metaphors used to express the close communication between the gods and the king» in the ancient Near East, p. 44). Such forms could be: cosmogamy (the union between two cosmic elements, namely Heaven and Earth); hierogamy (union between a goddess and the king); theogamy (union between two deities). Pongratz Leisten examines all these possibilities, providing several relevant Sumerian and Akkadian texts as examples.

Pages 47-52 are particularly interesting, as they provide a detailed overview on how the issue of the *hieros gamos* has been discussed in Assyriological scholarship - with a particularly rich bibliographic apparatus. Then, Pongratz-Leisten analyzes the phaenomenon of hierogamy and theogamy in relation with social dynamics (with a particular reference to kingship) and in light of Sumerian literature. The various forms in which hierogamies were enacted in various Near Eastern cultures (Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian) are duly considered and discussed. Ultimately, the scholar states that one of the goal of the Mesopotamian ritual was to emphasize the interconnection between the marriage rite and the king's active role in the provision of abundance. Thus, hierogamy and theogamy came to be dynamic forces in promoting the institution of kingship as a whole, as well as individual rulers.
