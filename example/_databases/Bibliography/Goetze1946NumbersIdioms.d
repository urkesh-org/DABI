An important article, with good documentation concerning (a) the phonemic shape of cardinals, ordinals and fractions and (b) their syntactic rules of agreement and word order. As for (b) the author shows that fractions are construed as substantives (i.e. normally in the construct state), ordinals as adjectives (i.e. in complete agreement with, and in a position following the head noun, except for nouns of time, which are preceded by the numeral: *ina reb&#363;tim &#353;attim* "in the fourth y ar"), while special rules obtain with the cardinals, as follows: disagreement of state between numeral and head noun, disagreement of gender (except with numerals 1 and 2), agreement of number, position indifferent (i.e. numeral either before or after head noun); as for the state, the numeral in the absolute state is indeterminate, in the normal state it is determinate, e.g. *kibr&#257;t erb&#275;tim* "the four quadrants," *erb&#275; uban&#257;tim* "four fingers."
