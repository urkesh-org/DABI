TO Abraham; apocalypse

<<The *Apocalypse of Abraham*, which has been preserved in old Slavonic literature, falls into two distinct parts …. The first part … consists of a Midrashic narrative based upon the legend of Abraham’s conversion from idolatry, which has several peculiar features. The second part … is purely apocalyptic in character, and contains a revelation made to Abraham about the future of his race, after his (temporary) ascent into the heavenly regions, under the guidance of the archangel Jaoel, who here seems to play the part of Metatron- Michael. It is based upon the account of Abraham’s trance-vision described in [Genesis xv](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=15&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls). -- a favourite theme for apocalyptic speculation>> (from authors’ *Introduction*).

[This book re-interprets the account and description of Abraham’s conversion from idolatry, as interpreted in this late commentary to Genesis, probably composed between 70 and 150 AD but preserved only in a later Old Slavonic translation, whose dating is still debated.]
