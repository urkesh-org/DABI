This volume consists in a translation of the author original book *Die Wahrsagekunst im Alten Orient: Zeichen des Himmels und der Erde* (Munich: Beck, 2013): it provides English readers with a comprehensive overview of divination in ancient Mesopotamia.

At first, the author offers an introduction to the ancient Near Eastern sources that shed light on divinatory practices; then, he contextualizes divination, especially extispicy, within the context of sacrificial cult. Maul provides a thorough description of the Mesopotamian extispicy ritual, and the most relevant points for reflection are mainly two: firstly, the juridical framework of extispicy, whose language was largely borrowed from the legal sources. Secondly, Maul emphasizes the binary system of extispicy, according to which extispicy was able to provide answers about the future only insofar as diviners were able to formulate the right questions whose positive or negative answers also had to be correctly interpreted. The author provides examples of such questions, that are known from collections which represent a useful source of information on the concerns that led individuals to seek out the services of a diviner.

Though the main focus of the volume is on extispicy, Maul also discusses other types of divination, such as rites involving flour, incense smoke, and oil: while doing so, he emphasizes that such practices were not separate branches of divination but variants of the same discipline, which followed the same hermeneutical principles.

Interestingly, in this volume Maul highlights the connections between divination, politics, culture and society with a particular attention on the diachronic development of the phaenomenon. He also highlights how the art of ancient divination was a system based to principles which may be considered akin to modern scientific principles of observation, measurement, collection, and testing.
