This volumes aims to investigate the many **cultic calendars which were used throughout the ancient Near East during a 2500-year period** (i.e. from the 3rd millennium BCE to the end of the 1st millennium BCE): it therefore discusses the structure of each calendar, the month names, and the associated annual and monthly festivals. The narrative is divided by epoch and by location, and it also offers indices of month names, deities, general terms, and selected subjects.
Cohen makes a clear distinction between different types of calendars: those which were "parochial or native", i.e. observed within one city and its metropolitan area; ethnic calendars followed in territories that exceeded the boundaries of one single city or kingdom; and national calendars, defined as «mandated for use in all cities, including those previously using a parochial or ethnic calendar, comprising a ruler’s kingdom.» (p.2). Finally, Cohen mentions the existence of universal calendars, which transcended the borders of cities, kingdoms, and ethnic areas.
All the ancient Near Eastern calendars discussed in this volume were lunar, and Cohen discusses also the available evidence for intercalation, i.e. additional months which were used to synchronize the lunar calendar with the seasonal year. The author presents the rituals celebrated during each month under discussion: he provides information on the available primary sources, the scholarly research made for each festivals, and the information which may be gathered with regard to specific cultic acts, symbolism and religious significance. Also the **political implications of the introduction and variation of religious calendars**, the change of month names and the use of intercalation are thoroughly discussed.
