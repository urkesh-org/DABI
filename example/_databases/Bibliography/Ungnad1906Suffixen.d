Reconstructs the original forms of the pers. suffixes for proto-Semitic as follows: *-ya*; *-k&#226;*; *-k&#238;*; *-h&#251;*, *-&#353;&#226;*; *-n&#226;*; *-kum&#251;* (?), *-kinn&#226;*; *-hum&#251;*, *-&#353;inn&#226;*. (Akk. *-&#353;u* and *-kunu* are influenced analogically by the respective feminines). The noun before these suffixes is essentially in the construct state, but often giving rise to a closer juncture. The construct state is originally not declined, but simply shows a vowel to resolve consonantal clusters when necessary; occasionally, esp. in Arabic, this vowel is secondarily made to coincide with the case endings. In Akk., stress causes a secondary lengthening of the vowel before the suffix of the 1st pers. sing.
