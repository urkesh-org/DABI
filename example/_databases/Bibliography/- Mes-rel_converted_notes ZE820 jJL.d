Spinoza proposes a modern interpretation of the absolute which is conceived in a way that is not dissimilar with polytheism. The extreme effort to maintain the purity of the absolute (to the point that divine intervention in history is denied explicitly, starting with creation) seems to work against the fragmentation of the absolute. The absolute has no face, not one nor many. But one observes that in the first place the notion of necessity inherent in a structural manner in the absolute recalls us to the amorphous and impersonal concept of fate that the Greeks called precisely "necessity" (ananke).

For a new interpretation, in which recent evidence contradicts Buccellati's affirmation that in there was no development of a "divine dimension of human beings in the grave" in Syria, see: {B}R/Matthiae2012Cult.



@NOTES R/7.1

It is important to distinguish clearly between human perception and the presumed existence of the object or subject that causes that perception. Too close a connection between the two leads Faivre to critique Eliade. Buccellati proposes a way out of the impasse with his distinction between "touched" and "touching". See: {B}R/Faivre1995Ambiguita.

TO 

A common idea (for instance in {B}R/Bettini2014Polytheism) holds that polytheism is more tolerant and less violent than monotheism. However, the two different religious views cannot be compared "straight across" and used for their civil effects. They differ at the level of grammatical structure, as it were, between transitive and intransitive verbs.



@NOTES R/7.4

TO 

Whether or not there is a "touching presence" (God) who reveals himself, the hidden reality (the "toucher") can only be accessed through human perception (the "touched"). Clarity on this point aids in avoiding sterile arguments that affirm or deny certainty about the nature and character of the "touching presence", and redirects attention to the historical data that are undeniable. See Faivre's critique of Eliade, and Buccellati's alternative proposal: {B}R/Faivre1995Ambiguita.

The polytheistic view of the gods as executors of a law or morality that originated "above" them also serves to resolve the problem of theodicy. See the treatment of Mastema and the critical comments here: {B}R/Hamidovic2015Mastema.

For a reading of YHWH's actions that looks similar to Buccellati's interpretation of polytheism, in that YHWH follows an immutable law that is in a sense "above" himself, see: {B}R/Mathys2015Colere. In this reading, YHWH's mercy lies in delayed retribution.

The Hymn to Shamash, partially translated and published in appendix 3 to "When on High...", describes the god as a judge who applies a pre-existing law. Note for instance verse 98: "you impose a punishment on him who perverts justice to pocket a bribe."

In the biblical perspective, divine wrath is the consequence of an opposition between two wills. For Gonzalez, it also has a pedagogical meaning: {B}R/Gonzalez2015Colere.

Mastema plays the role of the tempter, which preserves YHWH's transcendence while explaining a way that human and divine wills could find themselves in opposition. See: {B}R/Hamidovic2015Mastema.



@NOTES R/8.5
NA jJL

TO 

Buccellati affirms that willing is not a specific attribute of the divine element in Mesopotamia. Marti partially challenges and partially confirms this view in his treatment of divine wrath. The god wills, if he exists; but it would seem that instead the god is a stand-in explanation for events that occur on an intra-mundane level. Thus there is no coherence in the god's action. See: {B}R/Marti2015Repentir.



@NOTES R/8.6
NA jJL
ND March 2020
TO 

In the interest of maintaining strict monotheism, the Bible delimits the presence of spiritual beings other than YHWH. However, there are many different spiritual beings even in the Bible, and their character is not greatly dissimilar to the Mesopotamian demonology. By downplaying the structural radicality of monotheism, and simultaneously leaving the concept of demons somewhat ambiguous, Smith's thesis is weakened. See: {B}R/Smith2001Origins.
