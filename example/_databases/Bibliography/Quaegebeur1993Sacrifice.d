The volume contains 30 contributions to the theme of **rituals** and **sacrifice** in Ancient Egypt, Syria-Palestine, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and South Arabia, ranging from early historical to Roman times. These are revised and sometimes enlarged versions of papers read at the *International Conference on Ritual and Sacrifice in the Ancient Near East*, held in Leuven from 17<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> April 1991 to celebrate the centenary of academic teaching of Ancient Near Eastern languages at the KULeuven. 

[The papers, by their diversity, reflect the richness of international scholarship related to Ancient Near Eastern religious thinking and practice.]
