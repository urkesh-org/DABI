TO paleoanthropology; religious sense; values; functional symbolism

Two chapters are of particular interest: <<*Homo religiosus*: Le origini e le manifestazioni. Paleoanthropology and paleolithic>> (pp. 177/210) and <<Il senso religioso nell'uomo paleolitico>> (pp. 211-222). A survey of the data on the origin of religion, that leads to the conclusion that the religious sense derives from the very beginnings of humanization (p. 210). In particular, the author develops (pp. 185-189; 213-217) the argument in support of a variety of symbolisms that demonstrate the existence of a "universe of values": functional symbolism (symmetry in the production of bifacials, the domestication of fire, etc.), social symbolism (linguistic communication <<since the most ancient phase of humanity>>), spiritual symbolism (funerary practices and art).

[The notion of a "functional symbolism" seems particularly useful, but the consequences that the author draws (see also the chapter <<Origins and development of human language>>, on pp. 109-119) seem excessive, in that they are not sufficiently attentive, in my opinion, to the central role of articulate language and the substantial difference between it and embryonic forms of proto-language, on which see D. Bickerton.)
