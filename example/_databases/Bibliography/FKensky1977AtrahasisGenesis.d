This article asserts that the <<flood story>>, common to both **Mesopotamian** and **Biblical narratives**, reflects an "essentially identical flood tradition", retold and contextualized within the framework of <<Biblical culture>>. Not until the retrieval of the ***Atrahasis Epic*** could the flood tradition be truly related to aspects in Genesis, due to the fragmentary nature of the ***Sumerian Flood Story*** and the lackluster account given by **Utnapishtim** in the ***Epic of Gilgamesh***. In addition to establishing mankind's **reason for existence**, the Atrahasis Epic is comparable to Genesis in that it presents a "**primeval history**", detailing the creation of the earth.

In this section, Buccellati gives an overview of shared traditions between Mesopotamian and Biblical culture. Contrary to Frymer-Kensky's position that the flood myths are "essentially identical", Buccellati argues for inherent structural differences.

Buccellati explains the philosophy of <<evemerism>> in relation to Mesopotamian origin stories. He relates that Mesopotamian writers of the Hellinstic period applied Greek philosophy to origin stories and concluded that they functioned to explain natural phenomena via allegory. Buccellati stresses this in relation to <<polytheistic perceptions>> and <<reactions>> to the absolute.
