After renewing the argument in favor of the linguistic reality of the root, the question is asked
as to whether an affixed form is dimorphemic, say ma + qtal rather than maqtal. The author's answer
is that there is no dimorphism in the case of prefixes (pp. 76-80): a preformant is not a morhemebyit
self, but rather the prefixed pattern as a whole is a discontinuous morpheme. Suffixes, on the other
hand, are mostly to be analyzed as separate morphemes (80-92). Hence there is a limit to the use of
internal inflextion in forming and inflecting words, sincesuffbcation is a different procedure. The 
author's examples are from Arabic and Ethiopic, but his theory applies equally well to Akkadian, and has
been followed in this grammar.
