TO Urkesh; Temple BA; ābi; necromantic structure; Kumarbi

The **monumental structures** on the top of the mound of [**Urkesh/Tell Mozan**](http://urkesh.org/) are composed of a [stairway](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/J02/ugr/-frame.htm) (leading to [**temple BA**](http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm)), flanked by an *apron*, probably <<serving to accommodate an audience that might witness the early phase of a *ritual*, starting in the [plaza](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/JP/ugr/-frame.htm) in front of the staircase and then leading up to the temple above>> (p. 66).
 
The composite structure was abandoned around 1350 BC, with the coming of the Assyrians. Very likely, the cultic use of the area already started during the Late Chalcolithic and the sacrality of the place during the centuries can be argued from the absence of other installations in the area. The temple itself could be connected to a Hurrian origin, and the dedication of a first temple by king Tish-atal to Nergal (attested on the inscriptions on two copper alloy lion statuettes kept at the MET and the Louvre Museum) who can be better interpreted as Kumarbi, the polyad deity of the ancient site.
 
The other stone lion sculpture [B1.164](http://urkesh.org/EL-MZ/Mozan_3.pdf#page=220) (for further bibliography, see [Urkesh/Search/Topical index](http://urkesh.org/pages/a65.htm), under “Sculpture/Stone lion statue (B1.164)") found within the sacral area could have been placed near to the temple’s altar, while two smaller lion-shaped statuettes were place as a foundation deposit nearby the temple.
 
The paper focuses in the end on the [**Royal Palace**](http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm) (slightly later than the temple, probably around 2250 BC) and on the [***ābi***](http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm), the **necromantic pit** leading to the Netherworld. Both the sacral area of the temple and the necromantic pit represent a ‘trait d’union’ between the living and the ancestors, defining <<a very special Hurrian **ideological landscape**>> (p. 69).
