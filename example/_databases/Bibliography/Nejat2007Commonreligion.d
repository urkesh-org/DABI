The purpose of ‘Religion of the common people in Mesopotamia’ is to examine the **religion of the ordinary people**. Discovering this information has been difficult task as most written sources and archeological finds explain the official religion of kings, priest and priestesses, and wealthy individuals. This article has tried to trace personal religion for the common man from the development of the pantheon, the importance of myths, prayers, omens and the use of various forms of magic. This information helps us understand the ways in which the average man worshiped his gods, and, perhaps, entered the temples he helped build. (Author's abstract)
