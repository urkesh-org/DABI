This introduction to the volume *Storia delle religioni. I. L’Oriente e l’Europa nell’antichità. Tomo primo*, focuses on the definition of some basic aspects of the methodology behind a scientific **comparative history comparison of religions**. 

*Chapter 1* displays the basic question: “What is religion?”. The author stresses at the very beginning how the comparative history of religions, as many others, needs a deontological definition and a clear field of investigation, in this case, the term/concept of ‘religion(s)’. 

*Chapter 2* moves to another question: “What is the history of religions?”. After a presentation of different opinions or definitions of this topic, the author concludes with a basic methodological statement: the only way to conduct a proper and effective history of religions is to consider and analyse any specific religion in its cultural and historical milieu. 

[This contribution helps in defining the concept of ‘religion’ in ancient times, stressing how superimpositions of modern terminology can be misleading and must therefore be avoided in the historical and comparative analysis of ancient religious systems. The definition of ancient ‘religion’ is outlined by the author of the base on its actual manifestations and representations, a topic often discussed by G. Buccellati (see e.g. Chapter 4).]
