TO transitivity; intransitivity

This collection of Jacobsen's articles contains several earlier texts, including this one published first in 1961 in *The Bible and the Ancient Near East: Essays in Honor of WIlliam Foxwell Albright*. The article develops Jacobsen's understanding of Mesopotamian religion through the terminology used by R. Otto. In it he introduces his characteristic description of the early Mesopotamian pantheon as "intransitive" (notably Tammuz); he briefly treats ethical values and the presence of evil, and the concentration of religious attention on matters of daily importance; and points out several forms of religious behavior (acts of allegiance, anthropomorphizing the gods, and temple worship) as indicative of a development from the earlier "intransitive" forms of divinity to later more active, royal, "transitive", forms. These two successive attitudes, in Jacobsen's view, correspond also with the corruption of the ancient democratic sensibility into later monocratic attitudes, which "mostly took henotheistic forms".
