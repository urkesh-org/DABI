TO dullu (Akkadian)

The concept of *dullum* as "service" for the gods is particularly clear in *Atrahasis* and *Enuma Eliš*, where it is stated that gods created mankind and imposed the forced labor (*dullum*) upon it. See {B}R/Tenney2017Servility. See also {B}R/Jacobsen1977Inuma, where Jacobsen goes as fas as to propose the translation "misery" for *dullum*.
