<<We might provisionally accept that magical activity consists of symbolic gestures, usually accompanied by recitations, performed by an expert who is reliant on transmitted knowledge, with the goal of eﬀecting an immediate change and transformation in the object of the activity. If so, then a glance at the large body of cuneiform texts that have survived from three millennia of Mesopotamian history leads us to an extensive group of Sumerian and Akkadian texts that Babylonians and Assyrians regarded as falling within the competence of an expert called in Akkadian *ašipu* or *mašmaššu* (conventionally translated ‘exorcist’)>> (p. 418).

[The author contextualises within the Mesopotamian corpus of **magic ritual** the role of the ‘exorcists’, known in Akkadian as *ašipu* or *mašmaššu*.]
