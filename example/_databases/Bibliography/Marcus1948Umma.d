An observation by Albright, that Canaanite Akkadian shows the genitive
after *umma,* does not seem to apply in all cases attested in the
Amarna letters. â€” In an editorial note, A, GOETZE refers to a similar 
Hittite usage of *umma* plus a genitive, and notes that *umma* is
interchangeable with *&#257;wat* "word of".
