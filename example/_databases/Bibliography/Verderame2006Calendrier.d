TO time; calendar; Mesopotamian literature

This article aims to analyze the literary passages mentioning the measurement of time and the calendars, as well as to highlight the role of the Mesopotamian gods in carrying out this task. It also provides a synthesis on the units of time and on calendars in the ancient Near East.
Starting from the well-known passages of *Enuma Elish* in which Marduk fixes the stars and consequently the calendar (see [here](https://4banks.net/Mes-Rel/temi/time.htm)), the author highlights how another god had been previously involved in the measurement of time, according to the Sumerian literary texts. Indeed, according to *Enki and the World Order* it is Enki who was in charge of "Counting the days and putting the months in their houses, so as to complete the years and to submit the completed years to the assembly for a decision, taking decisions to regularise the days". Another goddess involved in the determination of time was Nisaba: in her role as goddess of cereals, calculation and writing, she embodied the link between agriculture, calculation and observation of the sky. According to the poem *Lugal-e*, it is for Nisaba that the days are counted according to the phases of the moon (l. 721). Verderame, then, investigates the astronomical role and the relationship between the moon Nanna/Sin and the sun Utu/Damash, according to three literary compositions: *Enuma Elish* V, 15-22; *The Exaltation of Inanna/Ishtar* III, 47-60; and a liturgical composition dedicated to Nanna 58-60.
The last part of the article deals with a general synthesis on the measurement of time in Mesopotamia - in particular, with the units of time associated with physical phenomena perceptible by men: the day with its different parts (such as evening, night and dawn), the month, the year and the seasons. In one final paragraph, Verderame provides the readers with a useful list of the most relevant publications on calendars in ancient Mesopotamia, grouped according to a chronological and geographical criterion.
