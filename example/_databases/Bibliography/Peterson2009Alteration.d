TO alteration of king’s dreams

<<A previously unpublished fragmentary Old Babylonian incantation collective that is housed in the University Museum in Philadelphia furnishes a duplicate to VAS 17: 28, a royal ritual text that is devoted to changing an ill-portending dream into a good one>> (author’s abstract on [publisher’s webpage](https://brill.com/view/journals/jane/9/2/article-p125_3.xml)).

[The author publishes in this paper an Old Babylonian incantation which describes the **alteration of a dream of the king**, in order to avert from him a bad omen. This is a clear example of how in ancient Mesopotamia the manipulation of the response of dreams was attested, specifically in the case of bad *omina* concerning the person of the king.]
