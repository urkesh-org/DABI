The pattern *puruss&#257;&#39;* carries a special meaning in that it serves to express a planned activity, conditioned by specific circumstances and procedures, e.g. *rugumm&#363;* "complaint" as different from *rigm&#363;* "call, scream." Von Soden lists 20 words of this pattern from transitive-active roots, and 11 words from "neutral" roots; in the latter case, the pattern means entering in the state of the corresponding adjective under special conditions, e.g. *huluqq&#363;* "economic loss." The pattern does not occur in the oldest periods because the juridical conceptualization was not yet sufficiently differentiated [but see GELB].
