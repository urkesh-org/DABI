This article is concerned with **relativizing the differences between Israelite and Mesopotamian religious practices**, in contrast to G. E. Wright’s affirmation of the distinctiveness of Israelite faith. 

Roberts points out several ways in which Israel’s rites are not fundamentally different from Mesopotamian rites. They have the same **end** (profit or reward), they seek to **bend the will of the god**(s) through a series of techniques which Roberts affirms are present both in Israel and in Mesopotamia, with certain small differences due to **monotheism**. He concludes that <<not even the most submissive and conscientious obedience to the divine will could guarantee the desired blessings--covenant or no covenant. **The good man sometimes suffered while the wicked man prospered**, and as a result of this observation, drawn from the actual experience of life, some thinkers in Mesopotamia as well as Israel, moved toward a more profound view of the relationship between obedience and the divine blessings. Man in the finiteness of his knowledge and power was simply unable to strip the deity of his freedom. This insight is most clearly stated in the wisdom literature of both cultures, but at least a rudimentary awareness of its truth can be detected even in the more strictly cultic texts of both Israel and Mesopotamia.>> (p. 187).

Roberts’ assessment does not fully account for the difference between the Babylonian **theodicy** and biblical texts like Job: there is certainly suffering on both sides, and the search for relief, but the latter texts ultimately do not bargain with God. They seek to explain suffering, but God remains above the justifications. This is in stark contrast to a Babylonian text that concludes with a transactional treatment of divinity—such that one can teach one’s personal god to run after one’s self like a dog!
