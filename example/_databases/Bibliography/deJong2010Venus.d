<<The chronology of the ancient Near East (2000-1500 B.C.) is not well established. A much debated anchor point for this chronology is provided by a series of observed dates of the first appearance and the disappearance of the planet Venus during the reign of the Babylonian king Ammisaduqa. The Venus observations allow four different chronologies: Ammisaduqa year 1 = 1702 B.C. (the Long Chronology), 1646 and 1638 B.C. (the High and Low Middle Chronologies), and 1582 B.C. (the Short Chronology). In this paper we reanalyse the Venus observations using a physical model of the visibility of Venus in a twilight atmosphere. … The Santorini eruption serves as an important calibration point for the Aegean Late Bronze Age chronology (1700-1400 B.C.)>> (from authors’ [abstract](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254913983_A_new_look_at_the_Venus_observations_of_Ammisaduqa_traces_of_the_Santorini_eruption_in_the_atmosphere_of_Babylon)).
