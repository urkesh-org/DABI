In this paper, the author presents specimens of **seals** from the fourth, the third and the second millennium BC, discussing their original **function and purposes** (mostly to guarantee the identity of a person within letters of legal transactions). 

The understanding of ancient function of seals can also be applied to clarify the mention of seals in various **Bible**’s books, such as e.g. in the **Book of Revelation** ([*Rev.* 7](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P12Q.HTM)), where the author interprets the seals as a symbol of the **Holy Spirit**. 

After a first introduction about the use of seals in ancient times (mostly focusing on Urkesh [**glyptics**](http://urkesh.org/pages/038d.htm)), the author moves to take advantage of this knowledge in interpreting seal imagery applied to **Christ** and the **Holy Spirit**.

Revelation as discussed by G. Buccellati in Chapter 1, Section 6 is obviously connected to the *Book of Revelation* [*Rev.*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P12J.HTM). M. Kelly-Buccellati discusses in {B}R/KellyBuccellati1996Seals the symbolic meaning of seals mentioned in several Biblical books (also in the *Book of Revelation*, see e.g. [*Rev.* 7](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P12Q.HTM)), analysing their symbolic imagery (applied to Christ and the Holy Spirit) on the base of a comparison with ancient Syro-Mesopotamian sealing practices. It results that the metaphor of sealing is shared both by the ancient Mesopotamian culture and by the New Testament.
