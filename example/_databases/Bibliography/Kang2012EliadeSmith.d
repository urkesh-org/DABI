TO sacred space; cosmic levels

**Sacred space** has become an important category in the study of religion since the mid-twentieth century, largely owing to the work of Mircea Eliade. Eliade defines sacred space as a space set apart, most significantly by a hierophany, from  ordinary,  homogeneous  spaces.  The  concept  of  sacred  space  encompasses natural elements that are usually associated with divine manifestations and thus religiously interpreted, such as mountains, trees, stones, or rivers. In addition,  human  constructions  such  as  temples,  where  a  deity  or  deities  are believed to dwell and communicate with humans, are regarded sacred as well. Often  found  at  the  centre  of  the  world,  sacred  space  can  function  as  an  axis mundi linking together different **cosmic levels**. People orient themselves around this “centre of the world” in order to transcend their world of non-reality and communicate  with  the  real  par excellence. (Author's introduction)
