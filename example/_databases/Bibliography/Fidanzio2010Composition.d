TO structure of Psalms

This paper exemplifies **how Hebrew Psalms were structured**. The author presents a specific analysis on the internal structure of [*Ps.* 84-88](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=84&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls), taken as an example of a typical prayer of the Israelite community. Such a structural analysis underlines how the elaboration of these prayers was indeed profound, later becoming the basic ‘prayer-format’ for both the Jewish and Christian religions. 

[Since the [*Book of Psalms*](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12409-psalms) is the basic source for Israelite prayer, it is noteworthy to better analyse and understand the internal structure of these prayers: this enquiry reveals how the inner structure of this book is a symptom of an elaboration of what was, in the beginning, a personal prayer later assumed as official or communal prayer.]
