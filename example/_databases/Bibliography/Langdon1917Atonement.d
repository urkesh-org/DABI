TO Babylonian atonement ritual 

This paper focuses on a **ritual of atonement** for a **Babylonian king**, specifically Tablet no. 1519 in the collection of the Penn Museum, containing a prayer by the ill-fated king Shamash-shum-ukin, a suzerain of Assurbanipal reigning at Babylon between 668-647. The king, because of his ill situation, is involved in the performance of a ritual of atonement which is recorded on another tablet of the same Museum (no. 1203), describing a ritual which continued for two days, along with a religious service including magical actions addressed to the sun god, in order to understand the cause of his sickness and to avert it from him.   

[This paper offers a possible Mesopotamian parallel (or, at least, a textual comparison) to atonement rituals attested in the Bible.]
