Cohen seeks to understand **why texts specifically containing proverbial wisdom were utilized in the scribal tradition of Mesopotamia**. Citing the persistence of the Sumerian Proverb Collection in the Old Babylonian scribal school and beyond, Cohen argues that specific themes were valued and integrated into the curriculum. Wisdom literature was not studied solely for the sake of linguistic practice but more so because the inherent themes had intellectual value. The existence of tablets containing texts of similar topics, "compilation tablets", illustrate the value of the content. Cohen argues the presence of wisdom texts in Old Babylonian literary catalogues exemplifies their status as a distinct genre. An Akkadian-Hittite text, of which only the Hittite translation survives, emphasizes the cultural weight that the transmission of wisdom carried, suggesting that practitioners should memorize and observe wisdom literature. The value of wisdom texts was two-part - they were esteemed by the scribal tradition for their intellectual value and were permeated into the collective culture as a benefit for humanity. Cohen argues these qualities define the purpose of their authorship to great antiquity or divinity. 

Upon examining literary inventories that seem to classify texts in accordance to genre, Cohen finds the **Series of Sidu**, a great sage of Nippur known for producing wisdom literature, present and cherished in the intellectual tradition and collection of scholarly texts. 

Proverbs from the Series of Sidu were utilized in commentaries of omen texts seeking affirmations of efficacy, further illustrating the author's point that wisdom held high precedence in the Mesopotamian world. Thus, wisdom literature had multiple functions outside of literary and scribal traditions, it was also valued for its intellectual weight and instructional capacity for the betterment of mankind.

This article investigates the relationships between texts and scribal traditions, with a focus on the development of wisdom as a genre which held significant cultural value throughout the civilization's lifespan.
