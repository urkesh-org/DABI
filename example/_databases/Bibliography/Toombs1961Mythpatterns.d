TO patterns; mythology

This article investigates the etiological nature of mythology. The author relates how aspects of reality that are outside of the control of humankind are negotiated, defined and mechanized in myth-telling. Toombs examines this phenomena cross-culturally in the Ancient Near East, demonstrating how traditions become historicized.
