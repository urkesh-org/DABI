TO creation; Genesis Rabbah

This volume describes the different interpretations given on the topic of **biblical creation** (as it is described in *Genesis*) in later Rabbinic texts and commentaries to the Bible, mostly in the **Genesis Rabbah**.

[The topic of creation is mentioned and discussed several times by G. Buccellati as the origin and the focus of any religious beliefs of ancient Israel, being that the result of the action of God informing the entire world with his word.]
