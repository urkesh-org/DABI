"It is a universally recognized fact that Akkadian does not tolerate the sequence of two or more short open syllables in the middle or a word." This rule does however admit some exceptions, which may be grouped in two main categories, (l) Sumerian loan words with double consonant closing "the word in Sumerian," such *abarakkum, igigallu*; this exception may perhaps be due to a special stress pattern (p. 235, n. 5). (2) Words with *a* in second syllable, immediately followed by *r*, as in *i&#353;arum* "fire." A list of such words is appended with references from 0B texts: *i&#353;arum* "fire," *zikarum* "male," *&#353;ikarum* "beer," *a&#353;aris* "there," *enerum* "aartn," *eneru* "provisions," *ebertum* "territory beyond" (a river etc.)," *a&#353;aret* "ten," and as Sum. Loanwords: *inarum* "wall," *a&#353;srum* "pile of bricks," *&#353;inerum* "bolt," *unarum* "uncultivated part of the territory of a city," *dinarum* "torch," *&#352;ubar&#363;m* "Subarian." (pp. 234-35.) Cases like *wagrum*, instead of the expected *wagarum* are to be explained as formed analogically on adjectives of the common pattern *paris*: *qamirum* (p. 237). Special cases: *1a-bi-rum* is to be explained as *labirum* (p. 236, n. 4), *nakrum* is based on two patterns, *paris* and *paras* (p. 237).
