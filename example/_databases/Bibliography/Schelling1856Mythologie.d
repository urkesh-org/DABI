The book contains a philosophical critique of the explanations of mythology that have actually emerged in history, as well as those that are theoretically possible. This first, historical part of the introduction was last revised by the author, partly during the last years of his stay in Munich and partly in Berlin, where he also taught about the philosophy of mythology.
