The element -t- is "inversative" in that it serve to express the ocntrast to a basic form: in the noun, it expresses the anti-masculine gender, i.e. the feminine; in the verb, the change of direction of the change, hence it is not only reflexive, as commonly assumed, but also passive and especially durative. Some of the argumentation is based on Von Soden (though no Akkadian documentation is given), but see VON DEDEN 1965 "Sprachvergleichun" 166.
