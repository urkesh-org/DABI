The author compares in this paper three different terms (Sumerian [inim.gar](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0031136), Akkadian *egirrû*, and Greek [*kledon*](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=59600)) related to the sphere of **prophetism** and ***omina***.

[The comparative approach stresses the use of different terms in different language to refer to similar concepts applied to divinatory practices in ancient Sumer, Babylon, and Greece.]
