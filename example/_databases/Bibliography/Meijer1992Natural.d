The volume collects many contributions related to the interpretation of **natural phenomena** in ancient Mesopotamia. In many of these papers, a connection between natural phenomena and a possible religious explanation (a kind of divine aetiology) is proposed as a possible interpretation of the way ancient Mesopotamian perceived natural phenomena including them into their religious sphere.
