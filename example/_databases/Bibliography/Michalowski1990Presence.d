TO noise

In this paper, Michalowski offers a lexical analysis of the *Enuma Elish*, focusing on some specific Akkadian terms which appear in the composition. Amongst them, he also investigates the two Babylonian words for "noise", namely *rigmu* and *huburu*.

The author considers "noise" as a metaphor for activity and creation and, in order to prove this metaphor, he analyzes a few literary passages - first and foremost, the stories of the Flood included in *Atrahasis* and *Gilgamesh* (see in particular pp. 387-389). Michalowski concludes that «The metaphor of noise ... establishes a privileged position for the concept of creation, activity, independence. (...) [it] asserts the place of humanity in the universe, not as a blind slave of the gods, but as an independent, creative being. (...) Those who would interpret noise literally in the flood narratives, claiming that it is a mark of overpopulation, have completely missed the point, for they would see human beings as mere puppets of the gods» (p. 389).
