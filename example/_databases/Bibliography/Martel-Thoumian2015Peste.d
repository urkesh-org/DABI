[Author's summary] The various epidemics that affected the Mamluk state between 872/1468 and 923/1517 were interpreted as manifestations of divine anger. According to the religious, lack of respect for Muslim morality was the source of the deadly wrath. In the face of the epidemic, many responses were made which expressed the fright of the population and the impotence of public authority, even if many victims were considered to be martyrs (šuhadā').
