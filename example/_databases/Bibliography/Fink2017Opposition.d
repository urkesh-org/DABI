In this article, S. Fink investigates three literary documents that might reveal a measure of intellectual opposition in ancient Mesopotamia. The scholar first analyzes *The Instructions of Shupe-ameli*: a dialogue between a father and a son in which the latter questions the established customs and values of his father by a radical way of seeing all these deeds in the light of the inevitability of death. The second poem to be investigated is *The Babylonian Theodicy* - a text which is also written in a dialogic form, and that investigates the question of suffering (usually explained by the causal relationship of sin and sanction), and that of the existence of a just world order by ultimately questioning the justice of the gods. Finally, Fink analyzes *The Dialogue of Pessimism* - once again a dialogue, this time between a master and his slave.

Fink's conclusion is that these three texts reveal that at least by the first millennium BCE, there was in Mesopotamia a group of people who argued against the rules of behaviour and the traditional values established by society. Such poems «demonstrate that there were doubts about the justice of the gods and the king. This implies that people were searching for something else or at least seemed not to be confident with the way things were organized by the state. They did not believe in an overall justice anymore.» (p. 177).
