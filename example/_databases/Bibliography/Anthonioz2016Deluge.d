TO Divine wrath; Flood story; divine anger; repentance 

Author’s summary: The biblical god is often an angry god. The lexical fields of **divine wrath** as well as the wide number of references leave no doubt about this statement. However, the biblical god manifests no such anger in the flood story whereas in Mesopotamian sources the flood itself has come to symbolize divine wrath. Even more, it is **divine repentance** that enacts the biblical flood and the destruction of humanity. It is the object of this communication to analyze the literary structures and the narrative function of wrath and repentance in the Mesopotamian flood story *Atra-hasis* and the biblical flood narrative (Gn 6–9:17), compare them and show their ideological and theological differences. 

[Anthonioz emphasizes the differences between the Biblical flood narrative in Gn 6 and the Mesopotamian flood story *Atra-hasis*. She describes the two main interpretations of the Mesopotamian flood. First, the moral cause that men carried in themselves the rebellion of the Igigi and made ‘noise’ (see Buccellati *When* 8.5) (*rigmu*). Second, that there were too many people, and that their ‘noise’ was proportional to their number, so they were killed in order to reduce the disturbance. The myth follows by explaining Enlil’s actions as deriving from a paroxysm of anger toward another god, Enki. The flood is later mitigated because of the action of the goddess. Note that in all of this, anger and repentance in the god do not refer to man as their object or real cause. They serve more of a <<narrative purpose>>. (p. 306) 

The Biblical story is quite different. The cause of the flood is sin, a direct and personal affront to the creator. (See Buccellati *When* chapter 8.) YHWH does not become angry; he simply responds to corruption with destruction. Human ‘noise’ or multiplication is not the cause of his action, so much so that after the flood, he repeats the commandment to multiply. The flood happens <<in order to never happen again>> (p. 310), and signals the end of divine anger. The many occurrences of divine anger later in the Bible happen only after the alliance on Sinai, in reference to human disobedience.]

Note that the source of evil in Mesopotamia is "dissonance", "noise", not disobedience, as it is in the Biblical account. See the discussion in {B}R/Anthonioz2016Deluge.
