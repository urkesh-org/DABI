TO Šumma izbu; divination

«Mesopotamia can be characterized as a “divination culture” more than any other ancient civilization. Because divination plays a pivotal role in the Mesopotamian belief system, understanding its hermeneutic apparatus becomes crucial to any study devoted to it. This two-volume book provides a comprehensive analysis of one of the most important divinatory compositions from ancient Mesopotamia, the series known in the field as *Šumma izbu* “If a malformed birth,” which deals mostly with malformed human and animal births.

The main part of the first volume elucidates the inner structure, the building principles and the hermeneutic code of *Šumma izbu*. The volume also provides a typological analysis of the textual sources used for the reconstruction and the study of the series and gives an overview over their chronological and archaeological distribution. Moreover, it surveys the structure and diachronic development of the Mesopotamian teratomantic corpus, from the Old Babylonian omen compendia to the so-called 'canonical' series of the first millennium, and explores its social setting. An English summary of nineteen pages concludes the first volume of the book. The second volume offers a full edition of *Šumma izbu*, the first after Erle Leichty’s pioneering edition of 1970. This new score edition draws on a substantial number of unpublished sources, for the most part housed in the British Museum, and a collation of those already published. It represents a significant step forward in the reconstruction of the series. A detailed commentary discusses philological, lexicographical and interpretative issues and attempts at contextualizing Šumma izbu within the ancient Mesopotamian divinatory corpus» (Author's abstract).
