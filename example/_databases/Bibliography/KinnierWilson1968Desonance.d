Omission of final vowels, mostly in SB texts, is explained as the
result of a desire to avoid assonance (i.e. to obtain "desonance").
This occurs esp. with case endings of normal state (e.g. *ana am&#257;t
&#353;&#257;ti* instead of *ana am&#257;ti &#353;&#257;ti*) and with pronominal suffixes (e.g.
*panukki &#353;&#275;du arkatuk Lamass*u "before thee is a &#353;&#275;du, behind thee
a Lamassu," instead of *arkatukki*). To the same phenomenon are also
connected cases of variation when the same word is repeated, e.g.
*adi ta&#353;ammam* .... *adi ta&#353;ammu* .... "until you buy," first in the
ventive, then in the subjunctive.
