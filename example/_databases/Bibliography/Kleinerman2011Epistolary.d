TO Sumerian Epistolary Miscellany; wisdom literature

The **epistolary ‘genre’** was a way through which ancient Mesopotamian (similarly to ancient Egyptians) transmitted **wisdom teachings**, usually to other known people, frequently relatives or sons.  

[This book offers a wide range of **Sumerian letters** which testify how this ‘genre’, sometimes in a fictitious way, was used to record and vehiculate wisdom messages and instructions to friends, relatives, or sons.]
