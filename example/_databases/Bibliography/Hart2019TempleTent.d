The central biblical text for *From Temple to Tent* is Exodus 24:15 - Numbers 10:28. The subject matter is the tabernacle tent with its altar and associated laws. In other words the theme of the text is Israelite cult. The biblical material presents Israelite cult in three ways - as Israelite cultic place in the form of the tabernacle tent, in Exodus 24:15-30:38, as laws associated with the tabernacle tent and Israelite cult in Leviticus 1:1-27:34, and the Israelites as the cultic people, the assembly of YHWH, in Numbers 1:1-10:28.
