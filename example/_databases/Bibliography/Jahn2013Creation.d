TO Mesopotamian creation; order; chaos

The contribution reconstructs the very idea of **Mesopotamian creation** (mainly of humankind) as it is described in Sumerian and Akkadian sources. The author starts with the analysis of one tablet (**KAR I, 4**), moving to find comparisons with other texts, investigating the role of the primeval gods in the act of the creation, the mode and aim of the creation itself, the Mesopotamian view of the universe, and the concepts of **‘order’ vs. ‘chaos’**, hypothesizing also a ritual context for such a text.

<<One of the crucial questions of mankind is certainly where he comes from and where he goes to, namely the origin of mankind. The monotheistic understanding of **creation** of mankind employs the idea that man is God’s chosen creature on earth whereas in Darwinism man is depicted as a glorious outcome of a long-term evolution. … However the Mesopotamian people who had no eschatology in their religious concepts went further and asked: What did gods do before they created humankind? … The purpose of this paper is to analyze the tablet KAR I, 4 (VAT 9307) which is a literary composition concerning creation, philologically and contextually, and attempt to place it into the long Mesopotamian literary tradition in terms of religious concepts entailed in creation myths>> (from author’s introduction on p. 9].

The thesis focuses on the analysis of tablet **KAR I, 4** = VAT ([Berlin](https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/vorderasiatisches-museum/home/). The tablet and its content are described and interpreted by the author in his conclusion: 

<<KAR I, 4 (VAT 9307) is a [**Middle Assyrian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Assyrian_Empire) clay tablet which is found at the [Library of Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Ashurbanipal) in [**Nineveh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineveh). It bears a bilingual text, Akkadian and Sumerian, written in three columns. … The Sumerian creation account can be seen as an **etiological myth** which explains the creation of the universe and of humankind and **establishing the order of the universe** by the gods present, particularly on the Sumerian pantheon. An analogical and structural comparative analysis of the myth with some other Sumerian and Akkadian manuscripts leads us to conclude that KAR I, 4 is a literary composition which transmits particularly common themes concerning creation and the world order associated with some other Mesopotamian myths, as well as in the monotheistic realm. … It may be seen either as a **school composition** paraphrastic, a kind of text with commentary which aims to teach the pupils the cosmogony with a semantic tool (such as gods’ names and professions), or a **reference book for extispicy**>> (p. 65).

TO Mesopotamian creation

<<*Myth and History*. At the core of each of these two perspectives lies the way in which we conceive factuality. Just as at the origin of inspiration we may or may not see an absolute acting as an external principle, in the same way we may consider the interaction of this principle with reality as something that is either factual or not. The foundational theme of creation is a specific example>> (G. Buccellati, section 1.7). For a brief but useful discussion on Mesopotamian creation (and mainly for the role of gods in this process), see {B}R/Jahn2013Creation.

TO order; chaos

G. Buccellati tells about ‘harmony’, implying the polarisation ‘order’/’cosmos’ vs. ‘chaos’; this topic has been analysed in {B}R/Jahn2013Creation, paragraph 2.4 on [pp. 32-36](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Jahn2013_32-36.pdf), with a specific reference to the Alla gods.
