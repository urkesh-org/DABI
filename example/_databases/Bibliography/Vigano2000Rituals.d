The author investigates the ritual text TM 1730, comparing this document with other **purification rituals**, such as the ‘ì-giš sag ritual’. The following paragraph is devoted to the analysis of the **sikil-ritual**, ‘the purification, cleansing ceremony’, presenting texts from [Ebla’s Archives](http://ebda.cnr.it/).The author specifically underlings the connection between the a:tu<sub>5</sub>-ritual with the crowning of the new king (‘en’) at Ebla. Furthermore, the ‘ì-giš sag-ritual’ concerns the use of **oil** (ì-giš), during the ritual action of the anointment of the new enthroned king; the author reports some instances of the anointment riual: sometimes, a similar ritual was also applied to **funerary ceremonies**. In the end, the author presents ‘cleansing ceremonies’ practised at Ebla, called in Akkadian ‘sikil’-ritual(s).

To conclude: <<‘The anointing of the head’ (ì-giš sag ritual) is not restricted to use in a funerary ceremony. Such a practice is performed for weddings and other occasions in which oil does not play the role of a cleansing element but is part of a ceremony of joy and celebration. Finally, the ‘purification’ (sikil) is performed in cases of **illness** that sometimes ended in death>> (p. 22). 

[This paper deals with actual realisations of religious practices at [Ebla](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html), mostly for what concerns the use of oil in rituals, analysing the textual sources with a strict philological approach. This is an example of how ancient religious practices can be reconstructed on the base of ancient texts, comparing them also with Biblical passages or with other Near Eastern textual evidence. On the same topic, cf. {B}R/Vigano1995Rituals.

TO Ebla; cultic activities

A description of **cultic activities** at [**Ebla**](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html), an example of Mesopotamian rituality, is offered in {B}R/Vigano1995Rituals, mostly focused on the use of oil in particular ceremonies (cf. {B}Mes-rel/Vigano2000Rituals and {B}R/Bonechi1989Ebla).
