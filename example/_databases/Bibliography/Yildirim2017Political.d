TO politics and religion; philosophy

This book is focused on the **connections between politics, religion, and philosophy in ancient Mesopotamia**: these three spheres were intrinsically entangled, since religion was ‘used’ as a channel of legitimation for the royal power and for the authority of the king as high priest and deputy of the gods on earth (as the case of Neo-Assyrian kingship). Philosophy (i.e. the scribal literary tradition) was the medium allowing this process of legitimation of the king to be affective and understandable, assuring the royal power with a theological (i.e. irrefutable) basis of justification.
