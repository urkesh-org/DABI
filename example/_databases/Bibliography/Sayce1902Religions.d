TO Mesopotamian religion

A good, even though dated, introduction to many aspects of religion in ancient Mesopotamia (specifically Babylon) is offered in {B}R/Sayce1902Religions (*Part 2*), presenting fruitful comparisons with *Part 1* on Egyptian religion.  

@NOTES R/2.2

TO comparative approach

The comparative approach is a fruitful way to better understand religious thoughts in antiquity: e.g., {B}R/Sayce1902Religions displays two sections including lectures of both Egyptian (*Part 1*) and Babylonian (*Part 2*) religions. The author rarely stresses *apertis verbis* specific comparisons between the two systems, even though the reader can easily recognise assonances and discordances in the two different religious thoughts.
