TO Ebla; cultic activities

This paper analyses the occurrence of some peculiar terms connected to specific **cultic activities** performed at [**Ebla/Tell Mardikh**](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html). The author starts outlining some recurrent elements:

1) the presence of specific priests, namely PA<sub>4</sub>:ŠEŠ = *pašīšu*, A:NAGA = *’à-a-um*** = *elēlum*, and É EN, literally ‘purificator priest of the lord’s house’);

2) an offering, NÍDBA or NÍG.BA (sometimes consisting of textiles, such as the *maš-da-bù*, a ‘wool textile’) to the god <sup>d</sup>Kura (the polyad deity of Ebla);

3) the syntagma DU<sub>11</sub>.GA, ‘order, vow’, ‘request’ (and variants KA.DI.II and KA.GÁ.II = *ragāmum* = *bâlum*, ‘recited prayer’), *i-sa-rí* (with variants *i-sa-i* and *i-sá-rí* = *išārum*, ‘to be favorable’, from a root meaning ‘normal, right’);

4) the presence of the term *da-mi-mu* (and variants; translated with ‘reciter, lamenter’).

As stressed by the author, <<the value that these elements assume is based on the meaning of some keywords, as indicated by Ebla’s lexical lists, both on the basis of prosopographic analysis, suggests the identification of an act of worship>> (p. 131; English translation by mDP).

Throughout the article, the author presents many texts from Ebla to better determine the exact meaning of the aforementioned elements, also providing a relative chronology as the examined terminology, thus investigating the **diachronic development** of the present ritual.

The main results of such an analysis are outlined on pp. 139-140: <<By comparing these data with the distribution of the sumerograms KADI.II/KAGÁ.II and DU<sub>11</sub>.GA in the expressions under examination, it is found that KADI.II *i-sa-rí* (and variant) is the formula used in the passages of high dating …, while DU<sub>11</sub>.GA *i-sa-rí* is the formula of more recent texts. We can therefore conclude: a) that the parallelism of the two expressions refers in fact to the same act of worship, as suggested by the constant presence of *i-sa-rí*; b) that both the expressions mean a ‘good luck prayer’; c) that the way in which this cultic act is mentioned in the texts has however undergone a terminological evolution; d) that this evolution may not be merely conventional, but substantial, if it could be related to what was observed further on … about the correlation of the two expressions with two different priests>> (English translation by mDP).

[This paper shows philological accuracy in the analysis of the original terminology (Sumerian and Akkadian) referring to specific cultic activities, priestly figures involved in rites, and peculiar offerings to the gods of the Eblaite pantheon. The philological scrupulousness strengthens the analysis, avoiding any superposition of modern concepts far from the original mind of ancient Mesopotamian worshippers. A further discussion on cultic rituals at Ebla can be found in [*Cultic Rituals at Ebla*](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/TEMI/Rituals_Ebla_mDP.htm).]
