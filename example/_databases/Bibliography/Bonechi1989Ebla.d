TO Ebla; cultic activities

This paper analyses the occurrence of some peculiar terms connected to specific **cultic activities** performed at [**Ebla/Tell Mardikh**](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html). The author starts outlining some recurrent elements:

1) the presence of specific priests;

2) an offering, to the god <sup>d</sup>Kura (the polyad deity of Ebla);

3) the recurrence of specific syntagma;

4) the presence of the term *da-mi-mu* (‘reciter, lamenter’).

As stressed by the author, <<the value that these elements assume is based on the meaning of some keywords, as indicated by Ebla’s lexical lists, both on the basis of prosopographic analysis, suggests the identification of an act of worship>> (p. 131; English translation by [mDP](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/authorship/depietri.htm)).

Throughout the article, the author presents many texts from Ebla to better determine the exact meaning of the aforementioned elements, also providing a relative chronology as the examined terminology, thus investigating the **diachronic development** of the present ritual.

[This paper shows philological accuracy in the analysis of the original terminology (Sumerian and Akkadian) referring to specific cultic activities, priestly figures involved in rites, and peculiar offerings to the gods of the Eblaite pantheon. The philological scrupulousness strengthens the analysis, avoiding any superposition of modern concepts far from the original mind of ancient Mesopotamian worshippers.]
