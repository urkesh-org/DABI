<<This paper focuses on such initiatic aspects of the Netherworld. Especially two poems composed in the Standard Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, the Standard Babylonian Version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, a work long ingrained in the Mesopotamian religious consciousness, and the poem known as the ***Underworld Vision of an Assyrian Prince***, may be thought to shed light on this more covert perception of the Netherworld>> (p. 67).

[This paper helps the reader in better understanding the meaning of the *Underworld Vision of an Assyrian Prince*, a text mentioned by G. Buccellati to describe the ancient Mesopotamian perspective on the Netherworld.]
