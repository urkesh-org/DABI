TO noise; disorder

This paper investigates the Mesopotamian concept of noise which, as also stated by Buccellati in ยง8.5, is recognised as a cause of disorder and divine anger. In analyzing the literary poem of *Atrahasis* in comparison with Mesopotamian incantations, the author identifies a parallel theme which consists in the sequence of noise - disruption of divine sleep - divine anger.

Heffron provides a useful overview on previous studies on the issue of "noise" in *Atrahasis*, questioning whether - according to the two main traditional views - this should be understood as a metaphor for sinfulness or, rather, 'simply' as the inevitable
result of unrestricted procreation. In *Atrahasis*, the "noise of humankind" (*rigim awiluti*) appears in a causative relationship with the Flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity: modern scholarship has thus regarded this noise as an allusion to something more "serious".

In this article, the two opposed scholarly interpretations of 'noise' in the Mesopotamian myth are defined as the 'biblical' and the 'Malthusian' readings. The first models its explanation of the Mesopotamian Flood on a Judeo-Christian account of human sin leading to divine punishment; the second sees the ultimate cause of the Flood in human overpopulation. While providing plenty of biblical references to previous studies on these issues, Heffron offers a fresh contextualization to the theme of noise, suggesting that an intermediate phase should be identified between noise and divine anger, namely the disruption of divine sleep.
