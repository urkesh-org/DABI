TO emergence of religious thought; Shanidar Cave; Neanderthals; burial customs; piety

This volume describes, through 14 chapters, important archaeological discoveries in the **Shanidar Cave**, located in the Erbil Governorate, in north-eastern Iraq, within the Zagros mountains. Here, archaeologists and anthropologists of the Columbia University, and later of the Washington University, uncovered graves of eight adult and two infant **Neanderthals** (ca. 65000-35000 BP), together with two late proto-Neolithic (ca. 10600 BP) cemeteries containing remains of about 35 individuals. 

Some of this graves shows relevant evidence of **burial practices** (such as the so-called *Shanidar 4*, known as the ‘flower burial’) and other clues pointing to people taking care of their aged members of the community, such as the case of *Shanidar 1*, the skeleton (later named ‘Nandy’ by the archaeologists) of a male between 35 and 45 years, presenting traces of proto-surgical operations, probably indicating that this ancient Neanderthal community took care of its elder people (a good comparison to the Dmanisi's *Skull G* discovered in Georgia (here a [brief introductive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=560hiKxz-eg)), belonging to an aged man with no teeth, well described in [Buccellati and Kelly Buccellati 2014](http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm), on [pp. 23-24](http://urkesh.org/attach/GBDalProfondo.pdf#page=24)).
       
[The book involves the emergence of first religious beliefs and cultic, specifically burial, customs in a very early prehistoric period, underlining how already before the *Homo Sapiens*, the Neanderthals have already developed a kind of prototypic **‘religious (or at least spiritual) thought’**, showing respect for elder members of the group and even **‘piety’** towards their dead. A virtual and interactive tour of Shanidar Cave is possible thanks to a 3D scanning and rendering realised by [ICONEM](https://app.iconem.com/#/3d/project/public/3682c9b9-b5c1-459d-b3f2-ea956eb3fa4f/scene/1de792c0-15fc-4423-8a3d-efeabb3cec56).>]

TO burial customs; piety

**‘Piety’** is already attested on the base of archaeological finds from prehistoric times: for a specimen of an early development of the concept (or at least actual manifestations) of ‘piety’ shown in burial customs, see {B}R/Trinkaus1983Shanidar.

TO emergence of religious thought; prehistory, piety

The discussion on the **development of religious/spiritual thoughts** in early times can be stretched until **prehistory** (cf. entries: {B}R/Hodder2010Emergence and {B}R/Schmidt2011Costruirono): for a specimen of an early development of religious/spiritual thought, connected to the concept of **‘piety’** shown in burial customs, see {B}R/Trinkaus1983Shanidar.
