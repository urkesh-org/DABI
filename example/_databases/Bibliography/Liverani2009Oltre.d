TO Israel; Bible; history

In the introductory pages of this volume, the author declares his ambitious goal of offering **a history of Israel free from any influence deriving from the biblical story** and his willingness to bring the story of the birth of Istrael back to its historical reality. Liverani roots his research on the most recent discoveries of textual and literary criticism, also making use of the contributions provided by archaeology and epigraphy, and on the basis of the modern historiographic methodology and criteria.
Starting from the observation that the biblical story is the result of a late elaboration, **Liverani positions the textual materials back to the time of their writing, reconstructs the evolution of political and religious ideologies across various historical periods, and firmly places the history of Israel in its Near-Eastern context**. As a result, the evenemential, political and social history discussed in this volume follows the thread of modern reconstruction instead of that of the biblical narration. In particular, Liverani chooses a bipartite structure for his book: in the first one, that he calls **"A Normal History"** and in which he discusses events that took place from the Late Bronze Age (14th century B.C.) to the Babylonian imperial conquest (6th century B.C.), he presents the story of the two kingdoms in the Palestinian area, whose experiences were similar to many other contemporary kingdoms that followed a similar development and were all destroyed by the Assyrian and Babylonian imperial conquest. In the second part of the volume, he describes **"An Invented History"** - which goes from the fall of Babylon and the edict of Cyrus (539 BC) to the mission of Ezra (4th century BC): in this section, he discusses the time and ways in which a huge and varied rewriting of previous history took place, in order to create the founding archetypes for the foundation of a nation (Israel) and a religion (Judaism) that would influence the entire course of subsequent history on a global scale.
