<<In historical times, and doubtless in the prehistoric period also, the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia -- Assyria in the north and Babylonia to the south, the land roughly corresponding to the present-day state of Iraq -- were believers in contending forces of **good** and **evil** and in a plethora of different more-or-Iess distinct **demons** whose good services would benefit the individual or the community or whose evil deeds, and malicious instincts, might bring hardship, ill fortune, disease or death. This may have been particularly marked in the late second and in the first millennia B.C., when the higher forms of religious expression may have been in decline and have given way to such **superstitions**. Probably, however, it had from the earliest times been a major concern of man in his ritual observances as in his daily life to invoke and propitiate the good spirits and to harness their powers in the constant battle against the forces of evil>> (p. 80).

[This contribution tries to define the entity and role of **demons** (divided into good and evil) in ancient Mesopotamian, retracing their origin in the interpretation of natural phaenomena through the scope of ritual activities.]
