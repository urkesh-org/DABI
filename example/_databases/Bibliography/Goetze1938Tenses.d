A thorough analysis of Ugaritic verbal forms, with the conclusions that (l) the suffixed form *qatila* is used more like the Akk. permansive than like the WSem perfect, especially because it has a stative connotation and does not funcion as a tense; (2) there are two prefixed forms, just as in Akk., namely *yaqtulu* for the past, and *yaqat(t)alu* for the present-future.
