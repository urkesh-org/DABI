TO speculative thought

This book offers useful insights on speculative thought in ancient Mesopotamia, stressing the existence of a ‘philosophic mind’ before the birth of Greek philosophy as ‘science’. More in detail, section 2 on Mesopotamia (by Th. Jacobsen) focuses on the description of Mesopotamian view on the ‘cosmos’, perceived as a primeval ‘order’ acting in all realms of common life, influencing both the political and personal sphere of interaction with reality. On the same topic, cf. also {B}R/Bottero1992Reasoning.
