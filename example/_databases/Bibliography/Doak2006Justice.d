While investigating the corpus of texts which may be considered as part of the "Near Eastern laws", Doak starts from the assumption that "the search for a comprehensive logic or rationale behind the desire to ensure social justice in the ancient Near East is destined to fall short of the goal" (Â§II). He observes that there was no Aristotelian logic in the ancient Mesopotamian juridical concept, nor were abstract ideas such as "equality" or "justice" ever defined in the Mesopotamian lexicon. Likewise, there was no such a thing as a Near Eastern treatise on the subject of fairness or social justice.

Doak analyzes many Near Eastern legal texts, including the *Code of Ur-Nammu*, the inscriptions related to juridical reforms left by Lipit-Ishtar, the *Code of Hammurabi*, and the "social reforms" promoted by Uruinimgina/Urukagina - looking for their social and cultural background and significance in terms of justice and the law. The role of kings and judges is investigated, considering each case in its peculiar chronological context. The author also describes, by making use of written sources beginning with the *Hymn to Shamash* (Buccellati's text App. 3), how Shamash/UTU came to be the main ancient Mesopotamians god who embodied the ideals of - and looked after - social justice.

Also the connection between writing and orality of law in the ancient Near Eastern social context is considered: Doak suggests that the relationship between "formal law" and practice was fluid and allowed for some sort of flexibility to meet local needs, though in many cases probably at the expense of consistency. Ancient Mesopotamian legal context, thus, was not characterized by that sense of anonymity and objectivity that is associated with modern legal systems.
