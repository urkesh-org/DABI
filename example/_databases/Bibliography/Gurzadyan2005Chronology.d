TO chronology; “Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa”

<<The recently shown two premises ({B}R/Gurzadyan2000Astronomical), i.e. the absence of 56/64 year **Venus cycle** constraints, at the importance of the 8-year cycle in the **Venus Tablet**, stimulated new studies on the Chronology of the Ancient Near East (2nd millennium BC). The analysis by B. Banjevic using both premises, however, did not provide anchors of strength similar to those of Ur III eclipses, while available solar eclipses lack unambiguous links to historical events. The Ultra-Low chronology …, therefore, has to be considered as currently the one most reliably based on ancient astronomical records>> (author’s abstract on [Cornell University website](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0607137)).

[This paper reviews the arduous topic of the definition of an absolute chronology for Mesopotamian history, mostly basing on the **“Venus Tablet of [Ammisaduqa](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#588)”**, a topic discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume; cfr. also {B}R/Gurzadyan2000Astronomical; {B}R/Gurzadyan2000Chronology; {B}R/Gurzadyan2003Venus.]
