TO orality and literacy in ancient Israel

<<Recent studies in oral tradition have shown that many societies produced oral and written literature simultaneously. Such a model for biblical literature proposes that a tale circulating by word of mouth only was virtually unknown, just as a tale circulating by text only was equally rare. Written texts circulated in spoken form by recitation long after they were committed to writing. And those recited forms spawned oral forms that were never in writing, or were not put in writing for some time afterwards. Ancient Near Eastern and ethnographic societies in similar situations also provide information on performance contexts for the oral component of this interplay>> (author’s abstract on [publisher’s website](https://doi.org/10.4000/rsr.1467)).

[The paper analyses the role of **orality** and the impact of **literacy in ancient Israel** through the process of composition of the Bible (a phenomenon similar to that involving the Homeric literature). Cf. {B}R/Michalowski1992Orality for the same topic on the Mesopotamian milieu.]
