TO sacred space; dur.an.ki (Sumerian); hierophany; center/periphery 

This article explores the opposing viewpoints of Eliade and Smith with respect to the concept of sacred space and positionality. Kang identifies areas of scholarly contention surrounding the **dichotomy between center and periphery**, challenging Eliade's assertions that religious institutions are centered and therefore sacred, rendering peripheral areas as profane, chaotic and even meaningless. The concept of **dur-an-ki** is examined as, from Eliade's point of view, the point of intersection between cosmic realms, or as the "navel" or point of union/separation. Smith challenges Eliade's notions of centrality by questioning the validity of his interpretations and provides insight from leading Assyriologists. 

[Buccellati and Eliade share the quality of utilizing structuralist perspectives in Mesopotamian ideology to explicate aspects of fundamental institutions; their focus is derived from their interpretation of the **absolute** being the nucleus of which all elements of the civilization can be deduced.]

TO centrality; absolute

Here, both Buccellati and Eliade conceive of the absolute from a pivoted perspective, see {B}R/Kang2012EliadeDuranki. Buccellati's concept of a divine matrix by which all realities revolve around is akin to Eliade's concentration on places of worship as the focal point of Mesopotamian ideology.
