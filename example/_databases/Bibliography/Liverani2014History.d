TO Ancient Near East history

This book is one of the most important publications devoted to the presentation of the history, economy, and culture of the many societies and people dwelling in the Ancient Near East from prehistorical times to the Persian Empire.

After an *Introduction*, setting the chronological and geographical framework and describing the Ancient Near East in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, five parts are devoted to the presentation of the history of the Ancient Near East from the Early bronze Age to the rise of the Persian empire. Each chapter roughly follows a similar tripartite schema: first, the historical background is presented; second, the main historical figures are introduced; third, sections about culture and religion of a specific civilization of peculiar traits or features characterizing the period discussed in that specific chapter.     

[This book is a complete handbook for the history of the Ancient Near East.]
