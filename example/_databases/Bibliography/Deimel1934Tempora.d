The notion of aspect is connected not with the tenses, but with the nature of the root. The
verbs of state express durative condition and occur primarily in the permansive. The verbs of action express 
press one of three aspects -monetary or punctual ("to die"), iterative or puntuative ("to tremble") and
durative or linear ("to pull"); they occur in the preterite for the past, and in the present for present and
future. The verbs of state become verbs of action (as ingressive) when used in the preterite or present ("to become great").
