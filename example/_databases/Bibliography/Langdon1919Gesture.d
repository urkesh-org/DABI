TO gestures

The paper describes some **peculiar gestures in Mesopotamian prayer**, linking the actual words of the prayer with specific actions, gestures, and attitudes helping the prayers to obtain the attention of the gods. The archaeological approach of the author, analysing artefacts such as cylinder seals and statues, helps to better understand throughout visual images the actual realisation of gestures described in literary sources.

[The author specifically describes some gestures such as the position of the hands (‘the lifting of the hand’), the act of kissing a religious image, and the prostration of the face (the Akkadian *lapan appi*, lit. ‘the touching of the nose’), finding similar attitudes also in the Bible, in Hittite culture, and in classical religious texts.]
