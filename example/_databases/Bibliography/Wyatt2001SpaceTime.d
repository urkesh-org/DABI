This volume is intended as a compilation of texts for students, for a course entitled "Space and Time in World Religions" which aimed at cover the cultures of the ancient Near East, India and Africa, Islam and Christianity. The book deriving from this class attempts a thematic and selective (though no complete) coverage of the ancient Near Eastern religion (Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Ugaritic, Hittite, Israelite). The main purpose of the author is to illustrate how ancient Near Eastern peoples employed metaphors derived from human experience to conceptualize time and space.

As for space, the volume discusses both cosmogony (myths of creation and destruction) and cosmology (the cosmic ocean, the central mountain). With regard to time, its reckoning (calendars), foundation myths, eschatology, and periodization are analyzed. The book also includes a few examples taken from Greek and Latin authors, for comparative purposes, and it extends to cover Second Temple Jewish and early Christian sources.
