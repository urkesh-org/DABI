A strong case is made for a Proto-Semitic opposition between *&#42;y&aacute;qtul* as prefix-preterite (= Akkadian preterite *iprus*) and *&#42;yaqt&uacute;l* for the jussice (= Akkadian desiderative *l-iprus*), based solely on stress. In general, this theory accounts well for the radical difference in meaning between various forms of prefix-perfect on the one hand and jussive on the other. In Akkadian, it accounts well for the phonological difference between precative *&#42;lu-ipr&uacute;s* *liprus* and asseverative *l&#363; &iacute;prus*, which remains unchanged because "the/initial stress of the verb created a juncture that prevented contraction" (p. 5). Rightly, the author does not claim that this stress opposition was preserved in historical Akkadian, in which the pair may in fact have become *&iacute;prus* and *l&iacute;prus*. In the conclusion a new historical development of the Semitic languages is presented; the system at the origin of this development is considered as having three verbal forms: "an imperfect *yVgat(t)Vl(u)* [corresponding to Akkadian present], a perfect *&#42;y'VqtVl* [= Akk. preterite] and a jussive *&#42;yVqt'Vl* [= Akk. precative]" (p. 21).
