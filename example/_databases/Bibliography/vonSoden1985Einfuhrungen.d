TO Mesopotamian religion; magic; faith; theology; theodicy; afterlife; priests; prophets; demons; death; funerary practices; sacrifices; substitute rituals 

*Chapter 12* of this important introduction on ancient Near Eastern studies is entirely devoted to the presentation of **religion** and **magic** in ancient Mesopotamian world.

Several issues are discussed:

1) a strict connection of **religion** and **magic**, two spheres interacting each other; **magic** is divided into ‘white’ and ‘black’ magic;
2) **demons** (both good and evil), **evil entities** (sometimes unburied people), and **ritual spells** aiming at chasing away the action of any evil entity; 
3) the perception of religion of **common people**: since we know religion through written sources, elaborated by a restricted group of scribes, the way common people conceived religion is of difficult access <small>[this opinion is also shared in Schmökel, Hartmut 1959, *I Sumeri*, Firenze: Sansoni, p. 174, about the construction of temples: <<We cannot know what the peasant thought when a bureaucratic order repeatedly stole him from his plow, imposing an exhausting job under heated sun for the construction of imponent buildings dedicated to worship>>; English translation by mDP];</small> 
4) the **list of gods**: the number of gods increased during time, being subjected also to later Semitic **syncretism**; 
5) Babylonian **faith** and **theology**: <<The tendency to become familiar with the Sumerian tradition was certainly constant, but a part of it, including many mythical elements of different origin on the struggles between gods, remained extraneous. They [i.e. the Babylonians] were looking for gods who combined the commitment to the conservation of the creation order with the assistance to individuals>> (p. 195; English translation by mDP). 
6) **faith** in Assyria: the Assyrians worshipped many Babylonian gods, but sometimes perceived them in a different way; they focused their cults on **Ashur**, the god entrusted to protect the king.
7) **sin**, **ethic**, **theodicy**, and **afterlife**: the Sumerians and the Babylonians perceived the strength of **fate** and interpreted **sins** as an offence toward gods, a fault to be amended by specific rituals. 
8) the **afterlife**: we do not have a clear description of the Netherworld: it seems to be a gloomy place, where there is no distinction between faithful and sinful people (only in the Babylonian period a possible reward for good people was envisaged, along with the punishment of sinners);   
9) **Sumerian cultic activities**, **sacrifices**, **priests**, and **prophets**: the author stresses the importance of the **sacred marriage**, a festival based on mythological accounts about Dumuzi, celebrated to guarantee fertility in all the livings; 
10) Babylonian **cultic activities**: many rituals taken from the Sumerians, adding new cultic activities; the most important was the New Year festival, the [*akītu*](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8381); 
11) **Assyrian cults**: the author focuses on the **substitutive sacrifices** and the rite of the **substitutive king**. 
12) **Purification** in cultic and magic was considered as a way to remove any external impurity from a person or a sacred objects, such as the cultic statues on which the **washing of the mouth** (*mīš pî*) and the **opening of the mouth** (*pīt pî*) rituals were performed (see [RlA](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#9681));
13) **death** was strictly connected to **fate**, remarking how graveless people were condemned to wander eternally in the air as spirits, without any rest; **funerary practices** (diversifies from place to place) consisted of lamentations, funerary processions, and burials in the ground (with or without grave goods).     

[Note specifically the discussion on the meaning of **religion** and **magic** in ancient Mesopotamian mind, defining these concepts as two specific spheres (exemplified by texts of different ‘genre’) strictly connected and interacting each other.]

TO religion; magic

‘Religion’ and ‘magic’ are particularly discussed in *chapter 12* of {B}Mes-rel/vonSoden1985Einfuhrungen: the author perceives these concepts as two specific spheres (exemplified by texts of different ‘genre’) strictly connected and interacting each other.

TO sin; guilt

A discussion about the concepts of ‘sin’ and ‘guilt’ can be found in *chapter 12*, *sub-paragraph 4* of {B}Mes-rel/vonSoden1985Einfuhrungen, discussing the perception of sin in ancient Mesopotamia, connecting this topic to the definition of ‘ethics’ leading to the establishment of specific norms and rules. Human behaviour is judged by the gods, as it is clear in Mesopotamian theodicy and in Mesopotamian perspective on the afterlife.
