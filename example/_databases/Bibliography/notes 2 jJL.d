TO before philosophy

See for instance Frankfort's affirmation at the beginning of *Before Philosophy*: <<In the first place, we find that speculation found unlimited possibilities for development; it was not restricted by a scientific (that is, a disciplined) search for truth. In the second place, we notice that **the realm of nature and the realm of man were not distinguished**. The ancients, like the modern savages, saw man always as part of society, and society as imbedded in nature and dependent upon cosmic forces. For them nature and man did not stand in opposi- tion and did not, therefore, have to be apprehended by different modes of cognition.>> (p. 4) See {B}R/Frankfort1949Before

TO before philosophy

On the question of method and the superposition of modern mental categories on ancient humans, see Frankfort in *Before Philosophy*: <<We shall find that if we attempt to define the structure of mythopoeic thought and compare it with that of modern (that is, scientific) thought, the differences will prove to be due rather to emotional attitude and intention than to a so-called prelogical mentality. The basic distinction of modern thought is that between **subjective and objective**. On this distinction scientific thought has based a critical and analytical procedure by which it progressively reduces the individual phenomena to typical events subject to universal laws. Thus it creates an increasingly wide gulf between our perception of the phenomena and the conceptions by which we make them comprehensible. [...] Primitive man cannot withdraw from the presence of the phenomena because they reveal themselves to him in the manner we have described. Hence the distinction between subjective and objective knowledge is meaningless to him. Meaningless, also, is our contrast between reality and appearance. Whatever is capable of affecting mind, feeling, or will has thereby established its undoubted reality.>>

TO slavery

On **slavery**, note the nuances mentioned by Oppenheim: <<There are no laws known to protect slaves against maltreatment by their masters, nor are such cases ever mentioned. Runaway slaves, however, were rather rare. The custom of adopting slaves who were to be manumitted at the death of their elderly adoptive parents after they had taken care of them in their old age and buried them properly, suggests that the relationship between master and slave was one of trust with mutual obligations.>> (chapter 2) in {B}R/Oppenheim1964Mesopotamia

TO control; unpredictability

The opposition between systems of control that seek to domesticate the absolute, and the recognition of powerlessness in the face of an unpredictable absolute, underlies the argument of the entire present work. In the biblical world, the theme can be connected to the phrase the "**living God**" as referred to YHWH. The unpredictability of God is at the heart of more recent readings of the Bible. See for instance S. Kierkegaard and K. Barth.
