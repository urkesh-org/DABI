{B}R/Lambert1975Pantheon affirms that there was an isolated attempt at numerical monotheism within Mesopotamia, which did not win out in the ancient world. It seems that this is at odds with the affirmation that each god represents (and exhausts) a distinct attribute, and is not a person bearing many attributes. However, we note that syncretism is obviously a major phenomenon, but it is, precisely, the “co-mixing” (syn-cretism) of well defined identities.

The notion of “beginning” is crucial in the Christian reading of history. Jean Daniélou, both a historian and a theologian, dedicated many important pages in his studies to this theme. And the theologian Origen, to whom Daniélou dedicated a ground-breaking study, waxed poetic about beginnings: «This Idythius, passing beyond these things with his strong spirit, solid and sovereign, passed beyond the earth, beyond the clouds and the angels; dissatisfied with terrestrial things, flying like an eagle, he crossed the entire haze that dominates on the earth... At last he came, crossing all nature and seeking God, to a transparent and total reality, and extending himself beyond his own soul, he reached the Beginning and the Verb who is in the Beginning.» Enn. Psalm. XLI, 12.
