TO Sumerian hymns; Appendix 2

This volume collects the English translations of some **Sumerian hymns** to gods and goddesses, providing the reader with a useful commentary to the texts.

[The volume is included in this bibliography because it is mentioned by G. Buccellati as the basic reference for [*Appendix 2*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Sources/appendix 2_mDP.htm).]
