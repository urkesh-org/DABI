An online database including information on **religions** (and the related sources) **of the ancient Mediterranean**: <<Tiresias: The Ancient Mediterranean Religions Source Database provides access to references to ancient texts according to topic, mostly on religion, c. -800 BCE to 800 CE in the Mediterranean area. In some cases, direct access to full text is also available. Topic tagging is based on existing subject indices from scholarly books, allowing highly detailed topic resolution. The site is in development, and currently includes 4,729,588 keyed to 53,361 subjects>> (from website).

The aims of this website are different and, to some extent, complementary to that on [*Mesopotamian Literature*](http://4banks.net/Mes-lit/title%20L.htm): while the latter focuses on a critical and comparative approach on Mesopotamian and biblical concept of religion, the former simply offers information of many aspects of ancient Mediterranean religions. Although the website is still a work in progress, it represents a useful tool for researches on ancient religions.
