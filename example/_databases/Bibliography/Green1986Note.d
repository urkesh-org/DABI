This paper tries to identify and describe some specific **demons** by analysing both textual and iconographical evidence from ancient Mesopotamia. Specifically, the paper deals with three figures of demons, called ‘Goat-Fish’ (*Šuḫurmaš(š)u*), ‘Fish-Man’ (*Kulul(l)u*), and ‘Fish-Woman’ (*Kuliltu*).
