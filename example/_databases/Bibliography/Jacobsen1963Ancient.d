The aims of this paper consists in re-defining the **concept of ancient Mesopotamian religion** in connection to specific “central concerns”, i.e. particular issues faced by Mesopotamian people, concrete needs leading them to the development of a religious sensibility/thought. These “concerns” are identified by the author with specific issues during the millennia: famine and natural disasters (in fourth millennium BC); war and ravages (in the third millennium BC); the sense of guilt (in the second millennium BC). The first millennium BC escapes this scheme, being a specific new “concern” absent: it was the time when Mesopotamian religious thought represented something like a fossil, reproducing previous ideas of the earlier millennia. Instead, it was elsewhere that in the first millennium BC new beginnings grow up, i.e. Israel and Greece, <<who jointly become the fountainheads of Western Civilization>> (p. 484). 

[The main achievement of this paper consists in the author’s idea of retracing specific “concerns”, i.e. human needs or necessities, which led Mesopotamian people to develop religious responses to these multipolar issues which evolved and changed during three millennia, resulting during the first millennium BC in a kind of “religious repertoire” later expanded in Israel and Greece, in a connection between Western and Eastern cultural traditions.]
