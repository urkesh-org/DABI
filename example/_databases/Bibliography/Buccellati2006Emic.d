TO -emic vs. -etic perspective

The author reflects in this paper about the distinction between the concepts of **-emic** and **ethic** under a linguistic and archaeological perspective: <<In my view, the basic underlying concept is the distinction between an open and a closed system, where -etic refers to the first, and -emic to the second>> (p. 12). The last concept is then well-explained with a concrete example, i.e. the perception and formal definition of colours in the archaeological recording process and in the common life, too (mentioning the example of the spotlights).

[The paper helps the reader in better understanding the author’s approach in analysing ancient cultures, on the base of an -emic perspective.]
