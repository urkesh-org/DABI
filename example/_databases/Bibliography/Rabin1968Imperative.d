The combination *l* + imperative found in three Biblical passages referring the speech of the "Sons of Heth" is to be explained as the Hurrian imperative infix *-el-*, *-ol-*,  with a change in sequential order (in the Canaanite rendering the infix is anteposed). A similar feature has not turned up yet in Nuzi Akkadian, but it may be compared with the similar phenomenon of the pronominal suffix expressing the subject (*ipallah&#353;un&#363;ti* "they will serve her;" see. esp. pp. 121-24).
