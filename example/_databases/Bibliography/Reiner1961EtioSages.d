This article focuses on the role of the **apkallus**, or the "**Seven Sages**", in Assyriological literature. Reiner translates texts that describes the qualities and origin of each sage: K.5119, Ki 1904-10-9,87, K 7987, and LKA 76. A distinction in the genesis of the apkallus is suggested ranging from human descent, fish, birds, and being "grown" in the river. Reiner notes differentiation in textual arrangements, and argues the mentioning of the sages serves an **apotropaic** function, additionally evidenced in the archaeological record as **apkallu-figurines** - sometimes as fish. Apkallus are thought to gift humanity with civilization and craft specialization, as described by **Berossus**.  Reiner cites convoluted interpretations with regard to distinctions between the epitaphs of early kings and apkallus. Reiner suggests a shared Near Eastern milieu that associated a "person of superior wisdom with a famous king". Fluctuation of the usage and context of the terms ***ummanu*** and apkallu is thought to adduce the role of the "**wise vizier**" or "wise men". Reiner states her explicit opinion that the role of the tales of apkallus may serve an etiological function, in that they represent "old sages from before the flood". Interestingly, the texts Reiner examines illustrates the apkallus as cosmic dissidents who supplement humanity with divine knowledge.

TO divination; technical skill

The origins of the technical skills practiced by seers, diviners, omen-readers, etc can be traced to the antediluvian knowledge deliberately preserved for the sake of humanity by the apkallus. Buccellati notes this reality is a "manifestation of the great plan...of fate".
