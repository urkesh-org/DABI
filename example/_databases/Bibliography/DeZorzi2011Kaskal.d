TO Šumma izbu; Appendix 5

<<The subject of this article is the ancient Mesopotamian omen series dealing with the observation of malformed human and animal births (teratomancy) that is known in the field as *Šumma izbu* “If a malformed foetus”. We will concentrate on the “canonical version” of this composition, i.e. on the more or less stable form it took in the late second millennium BC and that is best attested in manuscripts from the library of Assurbanipal (669-630? BC) at Nineveh. Like other omen series of Mesopotamian origin, *Šumma izbu* consists of sequences of conditional clauses whose protases or antecedent describe a sign, in the case malformations on human and animal births, and whose apodoses or consequents give the pertinent prediction. The focus lies on a synchronic study of this text that aims at elucidating its internal structure, at establishing a typology of the protases, and at revealing the associative connections between protases and apodoses>> (author’s introduction on p. 43).

[The paper describes the formal structure of the omen series *Šumma izbu*, see [*Appendix* 5](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/appendices_mDP.htm#5), investigating the logical mental process behind the cause-consequence mechanism of this text.]
