This paper describes the development of the **perception of time** and for the relationship between human beings and the **absolute**, conceived and assimilated in different cultures, throughout many millennia, on the basis of three subsequent steps:

1) the first step implies the development of a *‘meta-perception’*, strictly linked to language, which began in prehistorical times (ca. 60,000 years BP), culminating in the Mesopotamian culture in the 4<sup>th</sup> millennium BC;

2) a further step was achieved with the **biblical perception** of **transcendence** (i.e. from a mere, empirical perception of something regulated by specific patterns and regular norms to the existence and presence of an absolute embedded *onto* time);

3) the third step is represented by the **Christian perception of time**, moving from the simple notion of Genesis’ ‘beginning’ (ראשׁית, see [*Gen.* 1, 1](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=1&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb)), ‘inventing’ a new ‘Christian horizon’ involving the new concept of **‘trans-temporality’**.
