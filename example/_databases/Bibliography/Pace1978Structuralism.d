TO history; structuralism

This paper investigates the role of **structuralism** in history, developing a structural approach applied to the historical discourse. Through the article, the author summarizes the main previous researches published in English on this topic (focusing on an "Anglo-American intellectual milieu"; see p. 284), reconsidering them on the basis of French and German seminal studies.

After some considerations on **structural anthropology**, which is (particularly in the USA) tightly connected to any historical narrative, the author considers the relationship between structuralism and **Marxism**, the role of structuralism in popular **folklore** and in the **popular culture**; then, the scholar focuses on the importance of structuralism in history (presenting the case of Foucault), and then moving to the analysis of structuralism in American Studies.   

[The contribution is particularly relevant since a structural approach is used by G. Buccellati in his volume *"When on High..."*; see e.g. the THEME ["History"](https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/temi/History.htm).]
