An analysis of the notions "aspect" and "type of action" (Aktionsart") with reference to their historical development in various Semitic languages, including Akkadian. Following in part Landsberger's "Eigenbegrifflwickeit," the author maintains that the notion "type of action" is more meaningful in describing the contrast between present and preterite (which then can be stated in terms of rest ~ motion or stative ~ fientive) rather than the notion of aspect (incomplete ~ complete). Of interest is the section (IV) on negation, in which he notes how negation neutralizes the aspect of any given form, since an action which has not or will not take place is not characterized very precisely. An attempt to reconstruct the prehistory of the Akkadian verbal system is presented on pp. 100-106.
