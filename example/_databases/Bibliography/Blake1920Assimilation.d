Applies to Semitic as theory elaborated by M. Bloomfield for Indo-European, namely that "words belonging sematically to the same class have a strong tendency to influence one another morphologically, producing new forms which are a blend of several more original forms, as e.g. Latin sinexter, a blend of sinister and dexter" (35); this process is called "congeneric assimilation." After describing various formal means by which new roots can be derived (prefixation, consonantalization of vowels, etc.) the author gives examples from the main Semitic languages, in three groups. (1) Addition, e.g. Akk, &#353;elibu vs. Hebr. *&#353;u&#257;l* "fox": b added in Akk. because it occurs in other animal names such as *kalbu*. (2) Modification: Akk. *n&#275;&#353;u* vs. Hebr. *Lay&#353;*: 1 changed to n in Akk, under the influence of *nimru* "panther," *na&#353;u* "eagle," *nadru* "wild, fierce." (3) Related groups of roots, e.g. Akk. *zumbu* "fly" *zib&#363;,* *ziz&#257;nu*, *zunzunnu*, *zirxirru* "locust," *zuqaqipu* "scorpion," etc. With the application of the principle of congeneric assimilation one can voice having to posit special phonetic laws for sound changes.
