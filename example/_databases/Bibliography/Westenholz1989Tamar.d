TO sacred prostitution

The goal of this paper is to investigate the figure of Tamar in Genesis 38 in the light of what is known about sacred prostitution in ancient Mesopotamia, by means of a careful analysis of original sources as well as a comparison between Hebrew, Sumerian and Akkadian terms. Indeed, Goodnick Westenholz detects a confusion on the translation of the terms through which Tamar is defined in the Hebrew Bible already in the early work of the biblicists of the Greek period. She thus proposes to evaluate the prebiblical and contemporary records of the ancient Near East, for the light that these may shed on the problem.

Firstly, the scholar analyzes «the nearest neighbors to Canaans not only geographically but also culturally, ethnically, and temporally» (p. 249) i.e. North Syria and, in particular, the Ugaritic society. Here, as in the Bible, both male and female *qdšm* are attested - though the attestations are admittedly scanty. However, Goodnick Westenholz's conclusion is that «*qdš* in the North Syrian culture area referred to a group of people connected with the temple and its cult whose status was inheritable. From the Ugaritic evidence, we speculated that they might perform levitical functions.» (p. 250).

Then, the scholar provides the readers with a thorough chronological and lexical analysis of the attestations for the root *qdš* in the Mesopotamian sources, which mostly appears in the noun form in the feminine *qadištu*/*qaššatu*/*qašdatu*, to indicate a woman of special status. Unlike the west, there is no trace of a corresponding male noun *qadšu*. Goodnick Westenholz finds the most significant Mesopotamian reference in relation to the Tamar story in a compendium of legal terminology used in the training of scribes and notaries, one example of which is quoted at p. 251.

In the final pages of this article, the author ultimately denies that the phaenomenon of sacred prostitutes ever existed in ancient Mesopotamia, providing methodological, historical and philological evidence in support of her statement.
