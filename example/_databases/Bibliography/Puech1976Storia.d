TO Ancient Mediterranean religions 

This volume collects 9 chapters devoted to a general presentation of the main ancient religions from the Sumerians to classic Greece. Regarding the topic of G. Buccellati’s volume, *Chapters 3 and 4* (about Sumerian and Babylonian religions) deal with the beginning of religious thought in Sumer and Mesopotamia, the actual perception of religion in historical times, the pantheon, clergy, cults and ceremonies, mythology, prayer, and magic (cf. entries: {B}R/Jestin1976Sumer; {B}R/Nougayrol1976Babylon).

An interesting point is presented in *Chapter* 4, *Section 9*, where the author traces influences of Babylonian religion on coeval or later religious beliefs and the survival of Babylonian religious elements in other cultures (e.g. Hittites, Israel, Greece, and Rome), reaching also modern times through its influences on the Old Testament.  

[This volume offers wide chronological and geographical scope on religions of ancient Mediterranean basin. The *Prolegomena* offered by A. Brelich (cf. entry {B}R/Brelich1976Prolegomeni) present an admirable summary on many topics on ancient religion, starting from the basic definition of the word ‘religion’ itself.]

TO Mediterranean religions; Mesopotamian religion

The definition of the concept of religion changes from culture to culture: {B}R/Puech1976Storia displays a wide overview on the different religious thoughts of ancient Mediterranean basin. Chapters 3 and 4 are specifically devoted to Sumerian and Babylonian religion. An introduction by A. Brelich (cf. entry {B}R/Brelich1976Prolegomeni) sketches some basic definitions and concepts (such as ‘religion’) pointing out a common *fil rouge* behind all Mediterranean religious systems.
