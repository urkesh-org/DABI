W. Keller presents in this book an attempt of reconstruction of the historical milieu of the Bible (both for the Old and the New Testament), trying to retrace clues to prove the historicity of the Biblical accounts, on the base of archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East and Egypt. 

The author tries to prove the historical truthfulness of the Bible by using a comparative approach based on archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East. He examines the major cycles dedicated to the patriarchs, the kings, and the exile.
 
For instance, *Chapter 1* (*Section 2*) deals with the story of Joseph, stressing a possible origin from an Egyptian text called [‘Tale of Two Brothers’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_Two_Brothers), attested on [papyrus D’Orbiney](https://archive.org/stream/papyrusdorbineyb00britrich#page/n5/mode/2up) = [BM EA 10183](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA10183-1) (English translation in Lichtheim 1976, vol. 2, pp. [203-211](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Lichtheim1976_203-211.pdf)). 

[This book is considered as a classic example of the attempt of demonstrating the historical truthfulness of the Bible on the base of a comparative approach based on archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East and Egypt. The author’s approach, although criticisable and questionable to some extent, is a good stimulus to rethink about the [historical-critical method](https://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_criticism_osborne.html) in the analysis of the Bible. The author presents a different opinion from that expressed by G. Buccellati in his volume; while the Keller recognizes a stream of tradition from the Late-Babylonian culture during the period of the Israelite exile at Babylon (an idea similar to that of {B}R/Liverani2009Oltre, who is even more radical defining the Bible as an ‘invented story’), Buccellati prefers to reconnect these patriarchal traditions to a previous period (ca. 19th-17th cent. BC), namely that of the peregrination of Israel in the Middle-Euphratean steppes and their consequent contacts with Amorite people.]

<<Mesopotamia was the great cultural matrix within which the history of ancient Israel developed. While Mesopotamian civilization developed without any reference to Israel, the opposite is not true: the Palestinian reality of Israel meant that the confrontation with the Mesopotamian matrix was always operational. The self-perception that Israel has of its beginnings is emblematic: Abraham starts from Mesopotamia>>. About this passage of G. Buccellati, and on the topic of relationships and points of contacts between the Bible and Mesopotamia (together with the influence of Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures on the Old Testament), see {B}Mes-rel/Keller1956Bible, where the author tries to prove the historical truthfulness of the Bible on the base of a comparative approach based on archaeological data and textual sources from the Near East and Egypt.
