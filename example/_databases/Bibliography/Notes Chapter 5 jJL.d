TO attributes

{B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures (see especially chapter 4) proposes a similar understanding of divinities as "attributes" in his classic *Treasures of Darkness*. Dumuzi is <<little more than the elan vital of new life in nature>> (p. 36). See also the Themes section (Person vs. Attributes) for a further discussion.

TO transitive; intransitive

{B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures (p. 10-11; 20) has a similar way of referring to divinities as "transitive" and "intransitive". Jacobsen states <<We may illustrate the “intransitive” character of the older divine figures by the figure of Dumuzi, the power for fertility and new life in the spring. In all we know of Dumuzi from hymns, laments, myth, and ritual, there is no instance in which the god acts, orders, or demands; he merely is or is not.>>
