TO orality and literacy in ancient Mesopotamia

This contribution analyses the role of **orality and literacy in ancient Mesopotamia**, trying to evaluate the earlier diffusion of religious and epic compositions (later written on tablets) which were firstly performed and spread in an oral way.

[The contribution stresses how the core content of literary compositions attested in second- or first-millennium tablets could be more ancient, describing the impact of orality and the later function of literacy in the development and diffusion of religious or epic narratives (a phenomenon similar to that involving the Homeric literature). Cf. {B}R/Miller2012Orality for the same topic on the biblical milieu.]
