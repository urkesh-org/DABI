While Akk. and South Semitic have *u* as first vowel of the pattern in D and &#352;, NWSem. shows *a*. The vowel *u* cannot be explained as Proto- Sem. since *u* in thÂ£ verb is otherwise connected with the idea of intransitivity, whereas D and &#352; are transitive. Instead, it is derived as an innovation from *a* in the following manner: *&#042;ya-&#352;u-qatil* (*&#353;u* being the personal pronoun as suggested by SPEISER 1936 "Formatives"; the pronoun is *hu* in some languages, but this does not affect the vocalism)> *&#042;yu-&#353;u-qatil* (regressive assimilation)^ *&#042;yu-&#353;a-qatil* (analogy of stems with infixes *-ta-*, *-na-*).
