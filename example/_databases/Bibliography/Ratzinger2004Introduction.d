TO faith; reason

In the Introduction to this volume (“I Believe – Amen”), Joseph Ratzinger discusses to topic of the explanation of **faith** in relationship with **reason**, addressing a question related to doubts in believing. 

*Chapters 1-3* are devoted to the origin of doubts in faith, to the origin of belief, and to the problem of believing today, in *Chapter 4* the author analyses the relationship between science and religion, discussing the birth of the historical approach in the analysis of religion, the “turn toward technical thinking”, and “the question of the place of belief”. 

*Chapter 5* describes faith as “standing firm and understanding”, focusing of the concept of the need of believing to fully access religious world and the understanding of the faith in God. 

*Chapter 6, the most relevant for the discussion on the relationship between faith and reason, focuses on “the rationality of faith”: <<[…] “Amen” simply says once again in its own way what belief means: the trustful placing of myself on a ground that upholds me, not because I have made it and checked it by my own calculations but, rather, precisely because I have not made it and cannot check it. [...] Yet what happens here is not a blind surrender to the irrational. On the contrary, it is a movement toward the *logos*, the *ratio*, toward meaning and so toward truth itself, for in the final analysis the ground on which man takes his stand cannot possibly be anything else but the truth revealing itself. […] In other words, it is certainly true that belief or faith is not knowledge in the sense of practical knowledge and its particular kind of calculability. […] But the reverse is also true: calculable practical knowledge is limited by its very nature to the apparent, to what functions, and does not represent the way in which to find truth itself, which by its very method it has renounced. The tool with which man is equipped to deal with the truth of being is not *knowledge* but *understanding*: understanding of the meaning to which he has entrusted himself. [...] I think this is the precise significance of what we mean by understanding: that we learn to grasp the ground on which we have taken our stand as meaning and truth; that we learn to perceive that *ground* represents *meaning*. If this is so, understanding not only implies no contradiction with belief but represents its most intrinsic property>> (pp. 40-41). 

*Chapter 7* discusses the personal belief in God, underlining the personal character of such a phenomenon.

[The question of the relationship between **faith** and **reason** (raised by G. Buccellati in Chapter 1, Section 8) finds here an eminent answer. According to Ratzinger, faith and reason are based on two different methods (the former focusing of “understanding” of the *logos*, the latter on the scientific explanation of verifiable phenomena). Nevertheless, faith is not reasonless, since the aim of the believer is the “understanding” of the hidden meaning (“mystery”) of *logos* which(/who) is analysable by means of a logical and reasonable process, following criteria different from the logic of science but, anyhow, reasonable at all. Here, the opinion of the author can be compared with that of G. Buccellati, both focusing of the concepts of “understanding” and “explanation” of faith/spirituality.]

TO faith; reason

<<In the historical vision, faith in the pure and simple factuality of the unexplained invites a dialogical relationship with the absolute; while in the mythical vision, “faith” in the ultimate explicability of data, seen as a closed systemic totality, calls for an attitude that is wholly inner-referential. The contrast is therefore not between faith and reason, but between faith and explanation>> (G. Buccellati, Chapter 1, Section 8). About the **reasonability of faith**, see {B}R/Ratzinger2004Introduction, where the author tries to define the limits and points of contact between religion/spirituality and reason/science.
