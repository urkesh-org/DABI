<<In this paper two **Akkadian wisdom texts** are edited and discussed. [**BM 13928**](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1896-0402-28) is an unpublished Old Babylonian list of **proverbial sayings** and admonitions concerning a wolf and a king. **CBS 14235** is a Middle Babylonian tablet which describes the royal life and contrasts it to the behavior of wild animals. The two texts add to the growing corpus of Akkadian wisdom literature of the second millennium B.C. and offer a new angle to our understanding of **royal ideology** of the period>> (authors’ abstract on [publisher’s webpage](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/on-wolves-and-kings-two-tablets-with-akkadian-wisdom-texts-from-the-second-millennium-bc/2AC3AE29B8BD20E0FB47BDAEE0B8947E)).
