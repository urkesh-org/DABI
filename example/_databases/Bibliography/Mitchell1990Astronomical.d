<<The establishment of an **absolute chronology** for the ancient Near East depends essentially upon identifying the **recorded observations of ancient astronomers**. In this paper, Wayne Mitchell undertakes a comprehensive review of these records, starting with the ancient texts themselves. He concludes that astronomical data can form the basis of an absolute Near Eastern chronology, but that there are other solutions at least as acceptable as those previously proposed. These new solutions result from a re-investigation of the observations, using a computer program capable of accommodating various theories on the long term deceleration of the Earth’s rate of rotation. The date range of the computer run was extended to take in the radically low chronology proposed in *JACF* 1. As a result, there emerges the strong possibility of revising the accession of King **Ammizaduga** of the 1st Dynasty of Babylon down by 163 years to 1419 BC>> (author’s abstract on p. 7).
