On the basis of general linguistic theories (esp. Senvsniste) the author interprets (po. 251­ 57) the relative phrase as an apposition characterized by determination, i. e. the rel. phrase behaves like a determined noun in apposition. After a survey of the relative phrass in Arabic and Sumerian (pp. 257-57), the author criticizes Von Soden's conception of the Akkadian relative phrase as taking the place of a syntactical genitive and maintains that it is instead an apposition (259-75). In a phrase like *b&#299;t &#299;ou&#353;u* the construct state is not meant to introduce a genitive, but rather to express determination (274-75). Against Kienast I960 (“Punktualthema"), the author maintains that the ending *-u* of the Akkadian subjunctive is not that of a Proto-semitic model ending (see esp. pp. 248-49) but rather that *yaprusu* is the Proto-Semitic form to express unaccomplished time (pp. 275-82, esp. 281 f.), thereby rejecting that the form *iparras* may be Proto-Semitic.
