TO divine punishment; stigmata; skin disease

In ancient Egypt, skin diseases were understood as divine punishment. The author first establishes the **origin myth of disease** as Re's punishment of seditious humanity: in order to prevent outbreaks of human pride, the god invents sickness, epidemics and death.

There is a close relationship between skin diseases and other important features of Egyptian culture. Some skin diseases leave visible signs on the skin and disqualify from temple worship. Volokhine establishes a connection between the mythological explanation of a priestly garment (a panther skin) and the "signing" of Seth's skin by Anubis. He also points out the "signing" of prisoners of war by government scribes, which indicated the new slave's belonging to another: a loss of identity. Thus the **"stigmata" typical of skin diseases, in the Egyptian conception, refers to a divine "signing"** of the sick person.

Volokhine proposes to examine this mythological horizon and system of classification in an upcoming work.
