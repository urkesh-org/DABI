In a sequence of two syllables both beginning with *q*, the first *q* may occur as *k*, e.g. *qaqqadum*
: *kaqqadum* "head"; more rarely both consonants appear as *k*, *kakkadum*. The forms with dissimilation
are in free variation with undissimilated forms; most of the documentation is from OB and NA. The
second part of the article describes the nature of "emphatic" articulation in Semitic languages, and 
suggests that Akkadian (like Ethiopian) emphatics may have been characterized by glottalization rather
than back-pharyngealization (Arabic).
