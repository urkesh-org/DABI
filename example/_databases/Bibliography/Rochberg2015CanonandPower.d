TO canon; scribal knowledge

Rochberg investigates the nature of "canon" in ancient Mesopotamian text: she identifies the ultimate roots of the term 'canon' in reference to a set of authoritative authors or text in the ancient Near East, tracing the roots of the Greek term back to the Akkadian *qan&#251;* "reed" or "measuring rod". Indeed, in ancient Mesopotamian Art the very principle of rightness and conformity with principle was conveyed by the image of a god holding out in the direction of the king the rod and the ring: the gods who held those symbols were capable of selecting a ruler who would represent divine order on the earth.

Since the term "canon" was later applied to a set of divinely inspired texts in the Judeo-Christian world, Rochberg identifies the bridge between the ancient Mesopotamian tradition and the early Church Fathers' application of this same term in the texts belonging to the Mesopotamian "scribal scholarship", and in particular celestial omens and related texts. In first millennium BCE Mesopotamia, these texts came to be accepted as authoritative, and scribal knowledge became associated with antediluvian sages.

Rochberg explores several critical issues connected with the idea of canonicity, including the relationship between orality and writing for canonical texts, taking into consideration several types of sources through time. She also investigates the possibility of variations and innovation within canonical texts, maintaning that though <<the idea of a commitment to maintaining the connection to the past as well as to the divine, to continue preserving knowledge and the scribal arts, and to keep it within bounds of members of the educated elite, are all aspects of canonicity in the cuneiform scholastic context>> (p. 223), a range of internal variation was still possible. <<Texts did not become canonical by being standardized, but rather became standardized (or relatively standardized) because they had the force of authority for a community of scribes. The canonicity (...) was held in common, though for different reasons, by the schoolmasters of the *edubba* and the scribes.>> (p. 225)

Rochberg, thus, identifies the ultimate origin of canonicity in the restricted circles of Near Eastern scholars and scribes, who gave authority to the written compositions; she also claims that in Mesopotamia - as in all other human societies - <<the canon of texts (or images, or any other canonical cultural form) has its status by virtue of its ability to communicate living ideas>>, thus transcending the needs of a single individual or community.
