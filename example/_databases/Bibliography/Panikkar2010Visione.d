This volume has the ambition to present a vision of reality, a cosmovision, different from the current cosmology in the dominant culture. The trinitarian vision of reality is not limited to the conception that is called Christian: it is much more ample and universal. Humanity has always had a more or less clear consciousness of a superior Mystery, transcendent or immanent to Man. [... The cosmotheandric] vision tells us that reality is not formed by a single indistinct block - be it divine, spiritual, or material -, nor by three blocks or a world on three levels / the world of the Gods (or of Transcendence), the world of men (or of Consciousness) and the physical world (or of Matter) /, as if it were a building with three floors. Reality is constituted by three dimensions related to each other - the trinitarian perichoresis -, in such a way that not only does one not exist without the other, but all three are interwoven inter-in-dependently.
