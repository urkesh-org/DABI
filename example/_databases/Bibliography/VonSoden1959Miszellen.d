P. 50: use of *-atta(m)*, *-atti* as adverbial ending in late texts. P.52: existence of a phoneme *&#345;* in Sumerian, and of the same sound as a phonetic, but not phonemic, peculiarity in OB (e.g. *ma-&#231;a-a&#353;-ti* for *ma&#231;&#231;arti*) and NB. P. 55: Different weak roots with the same meaning indicate that in Old Semitic weak roots may have had alternating realizations; in Akkadian such cases are rare, but not impossible, e.g. *dkk* ~ *d&#363;k* "to crush," *rtt* ~ *r&#363;d* "to tremble," *kpp* ~ *kp* "to bend," *rgg* ~ *rg* in the D "to make bad."
