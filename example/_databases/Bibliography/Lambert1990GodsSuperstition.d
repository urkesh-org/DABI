In this article, Lambert offers a condensed synthesis of the ancient Mesopotamian religion. This text is interesting because of the approach that it uses, as it is described by the author in the opening paragraph that aims to justify the wording used for the title: <<The terms "superstition", "philosophy" and "theology" have been deliberately chosen as raw, crude terms to avoid a powerful terminology which would take over the subject by imposing its own concepts on the discussion. By "superstition" the emotional content of religion is meant ; "philosophy" is used to refer to the rational element in religion (with an implicit objection to those who might wish to assert that abstract thought began with the Greeks) ; and "theology" refers to the amalgam of these emotional and rational elements.>> (p. 116) 

While discussing Mesopotamian religion on the basis of Sumerian and Akkadian texts, Lambert highlights some interesting facts: firstly, that there is virtually no duplication in the Sumerian city patron gods - a fact that he justifies with a well-thought organization of the pantheon made *ab origine* by Sumerian theologians. 

Then, while noting that gods with greater cosmic importance (such as those linked to the sky and the earth) were more important than those concerned with human crafts, the scholar suggests that this might have been due to both the strength of a millennia-long tradition and "common sense" on the part of theologians. 

Lambert also discusses the fact that by both theological thinking and the power of priests of major temples, the total number of different gods was diminished over the centuries - one consequence of this fact being an increase in the names of the main deities. Taking Marduk as an example, Lambert notes how in the late-second and first millennium BCE no less than fifty names were attributed to that god - consisting of the sum of his own names and epithets, and of names of those gods whom he had absorbed by being equated with them by Mesopotamian theologians. As a final step, Marduk by the late second millennium had become head of the pantheon, resulting in a kind of monotheism. Lambert also highlights, however, that this was quite a unique phenomenon: other gods always remained separate beings.

Lambert, then, tackles the issue of whether the Mesopotamian anthropomorphic divine representations were preceded by a theriomorphic stage. He analyses symbols used to represent gods in various types of artistic forms, and he comes to the conclusion that supporting evidence of a pre-anthropomorphic stage of religion is lacking.
