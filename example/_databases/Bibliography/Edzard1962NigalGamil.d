In personal names including a feminine divine name and applying to a male individual, the 
agreement of the predicate is with the individual rather than with the divine name. Tnis rule applies 
regularly when the predicate is nominal (m Ningal-gamil); with a verbal predicate (l&#353;tar-idinnam) it is 
regularly only in OB and NB/LB. This emphasizes the fact that PN's were considered as compounds, 
so that the gender characterization is meant to apply to the name as a whole.
