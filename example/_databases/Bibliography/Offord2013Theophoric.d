TO Babylonian and Hebrew theophoric names

This paper presents a discussion on **Babylonian and Hebrew theophoric names**, explaining the meaning and the symbolic value of using names of gods in composing personal names.

[The comparative approach of this paper allows to enucleate similarities and mainly differences in naming practices in Mesopotamia and Israel, due to the different theological conception of God (in Israel) vs. gods (in Mesopotamia).]
