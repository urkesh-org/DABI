TO emergence of religious thought; Anatolia; prehistory; cultic activities; ancestor cults; funerary practices; totemic/shamanic beliefs 

This volume, written by [Klaus Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schmidt_(archaeologist)), director of excavations at [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) (cf. [DAINST](https://www.dainst.org/projekt/-/project-display/21890)) from 1996 to 2014, describes the discovery of this ancient prehistorical site in South-Eastern Anatolia, comparing it with other similar structures or with different archaeological sites in other country of the Middle-Near East. 

The purpose of the volume is to highlight the development and emergence of religious/spiritual thought (and its connection to agriculture) in a ‘society’ (I mean with this term simply a group of people) of the [Pre-Pottery Neolithic A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Pottery_Neolithic_A) period (i.e. ca. 10000-8800 BC).  

The volume develops in a narrative way, retracing the paths of the discovery and excavation of the site.

*Chapter 1* describes the beginning of investigation in the area of the site.

*Chapter 2* presents comparisons with other prehistorical and proto-historical sites like [**Jericho**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho), the [**“Hilly Flanks”**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilly_Flanks), [**‘Ain Ghazal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Ain_Ghazal), [**Ofnet Caves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofnet_Caves), [**Çatalhöyük**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk) (cf. entry: {B}Mes-rel/Hodder2010Emergence), [**Çayönü**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87ay%C3%B6n%C3%BC), [**Nevali Çori**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neval%C4%B1_%C3%87ori), and [**Gürcütepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCrc%C3%BCtepe), dealing with topics related to **cultic activities** and **funerary practices** in pre-urban (i.e. hunting-gathering groups) and proto-urban societies.
  
*Chapter 3* focuses on [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe), describing the structures and meaning of its first megalithic, circular structures, with the typical **“T-shape stelae/pillars”**, interpreted as early ‘shrines’ (probably hypetral), representing a meeting places for hunting-gathering people where **cultic activities** were performed (also probably connected to **ancestor cult** and **funerary practices**).   

*Chapter 4* investigates the meaning of the animals (snakes, foxes, oxen, cranes, leopards, lions, *et al.*) and other human-entities represented on the **“T-shape stelae/pillars”**, comparing them with other depictions at [**Karacadağ**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaca_Da%C4%9F) and the [**Sahara**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara) (spiders, millipedes, a “goat demon”, “dog-head demons”), advancing comparisons with other Neolithic sites (such as [**Stonehenge**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge)), or other pillars elsewhere (such as the Egyptian obelisks). The aim of this comparison is to better understand the meaning of these representations in the **cultural memory** of [**Stone Age**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age) communities. Three further considerations are advanced: 1) the possibility of interpreting [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) as the Sumerian [**Du-Ku** mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du-Ku); 2) the analysis of [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe)’s depictions are **proto-petroglyphs**; 3) the possible retrieving of **totemic/shamanic beliefs** at [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe).

*Chapter 5* analyses two topics: *paragraph 1* describes the more recent structures, peculiarly the “Building with the lion-pillar”, dealing with specific human representations (sometimes with ithyphallic men or women with *macronymphia*); this passage from the representation of wild animals to the depiction of human beings is interpreted (following a suggestion of [Jacques Cauvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cauvin)) as a possible connection to fertility, <<a transformation denoting the passage from a hunting-gathering society to a food-producing society, i.e. based on agriculture’ (p. 228; English translation by mDP). *Paragraph 2* focuses on the relationships between hunting-gathering human groups and the early agricultural societies (and the passage from dispersal occupations to villages and later to cities), describing the cultic/religious function (as a ‘proto-shrine’) of [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe)’s buildings, and the relationship of agriculture (as a cause or a consequence) with the development of a religious thought.

[The contribution is particularly relevant as an introduction to the first attested forms of religiosity and rituals in the ancient site of [**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe), in South-Eastern Anatolia. The ability of the author consists in outlining through the stones of these prehistorical structures a possible religious explanation for the construction of these first ‘shrines’, an explanation which benefits also from anthropological theories.]

TO prehistory; emergence of religious thought

As noted for {B}Mes-rel/Hodder2010Emergence (related to [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk)), G. Buccellati presents in this section basic questions on the emergence of religious thoughts and cultic practices in prehistory, a period not documented by textual sources but only by archaeological evidence. For the emergence of religious thoughts and cultic practices in prehistorical South-Eastern Anatolia, mostly at [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) (one of the earliest site in the world), see {B}R/Schmidt2011Costruirono.
