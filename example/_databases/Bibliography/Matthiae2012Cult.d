TO divinized kings

In this article, published after "Quando" went to print, the author provides an interpretation of the development of Syria that shows greater continuity, and an earlier development of the sense of existence beyond the tomb, than has been thought in the past. Matthiae presents evidence that the **cult of divinized ancestor kings does exist continuously from about 2400-2300 BCE to 900-720 BCE** in Ebla. He presents five major reasons for this position.

First, there are two ritual texts from the Royal Archives of Ebla, which he dates to 2350-2300 BCE, dealing with enthroning a new king. Both rites mention divinized previous kings by name.

Second, there is a monumental tomb underneath the royal palace in Ebla, Hypogee G4, of the same era. Its presence indicates a change with respect to the textual tradition, which mentions burial outside of the city of Ebla. Not without some hesitation, Matthiae proposes that this change indicates, on the part of Ishar-Damu, an "ideological revolution of the concept of royalty? to adhere to the tradition of the great Mesopotamian urban powers."

A third piece of evidence can be found in three tombs at Tell Mardikh (1850-1700 BCE). One of these is very probably the tomb of king Immeya. A two-faced ritual talisman found in it "summarizes the two essential moments of the assumption of the dead and divinized king among the royal ancestors who have become gods": the funeral banquet, and the ascension of the dead king to the heavens.

Fourthly, three poetic fragments (KTU 1.20-22) dealing with the Rapi'uma are, in Matthaiae's estimation, to be understood as referring to divinized kings.

Finally, a complex of buildings connect the temple of the god of the underworld, Rashap, to the sanctuary of divinized ancestors (1800-1600 BCE) entombed under the living quarters of the crown prince. Matthiae concludes that the "tradition of the divinization of dead kings and faith in the essential protection these divine beings offer the community of the living, the reigning household, and the whole of society, derive in Syria from the very beginnings of urban life", that is, around the second half of the third millenium BCE.
