<<From antiquity, individuals, tribes, and cultures have sought the abilities of singular individuals to try to heal them or to help them to endure the onslaughts of disease. For thousands of years before recorded history, these services were provided by the **medicine man or shaman** of the tribe, whose secret treatments were passed from generation to generation by the apprenticeship methods of teaching. For the most part, their therapies were at best palliative and their effects were placebo and psychological in nature>> (from authors’ abstract on [publisher’s webpage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2129621/)).

[This paper describes the historical development of the medicine as a ‘hard science’, moving from the antiquity, specifically mentioning some features of the Egyptian medicine and Mesopotamian therapeutic practices, sometimes relayed to rituals, such as those aiming at averting a **toothache caused by worms**.]
