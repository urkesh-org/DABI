TO "protoeuphratian substratum"

In this article, Rubio discusses the so-called "Sumerian problem", namely he attampts to find an answer to the long-debated issue whether the Sumerians were an autochthonous Mesopotamian population or they came from somewhere else. In his investigation, he looks at both the textual and the archeological evidence.

Rubio questions the very idea of a "pre-Sumerian substratum" (or "protoeuphratian substratum"), which is supported by Buccellati in ยง6.2. Such theory was first proposed by Landsberger (1944; 1974) and later developed by Gelb (1960), Oppenheim (1967), Salonen (1952; 1968; 1969), and Diakonoff (1975). However, after looking in details at Landsberger's and (more recently) Whittaker's publications on this topic - and rooting his analysis on philological and historical grounds, the scholar ultimately denies the existence of such "alleged substratum".

Rubio's conclusion is that <<there is no monolithic substratum that would have left, in a sort of primeval age, its vestiges in  the Sumerian lexicon. (...) Furthermore, and from a theoretical point of view, one should not overlook that the search for origins  (Ursprache, Urheimat, etc.) is an intellectual construct of the past - frequently a misconstruction of it - and belongs to the realm of our concerns as scholars rather than to the world of events>> (p. 11).
