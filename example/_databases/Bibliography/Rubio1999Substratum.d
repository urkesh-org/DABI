TO Pre-Sumerian substratum

<<One of the most discussed Assyriological topics is the “Sumerian problem”: Were the Sumerians an autochthonous Mesopotamian population or did they come from somewhere else? In order to answer this question one has to take a look at both the textual and the archeological materials we have. The archeological and environmental evidence seem to allow different, and even contradictory, readings and interpretations>> (from p. 1).

[This paper discusses the problem of the Sumerian origin, a topic still deeply debated among modern scholars. It also deals with the problem of the origin of Sumerian language, discussing the existence of a possible **‘Pre-Sumerian substratum’**.]
