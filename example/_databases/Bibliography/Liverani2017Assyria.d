TO Neo-Assyrian Empire; legitimation of political power

This book presents the historical growth and development of the **Neo-Assyrian Empire**, describing all its peculiar features (in politics, religion, society, and culture) stressing the elements of continuity and discontinuity with the previous Middle Assyrian Kingdom, focusing of the key point of the passage from the ideology of the ‘Kingdom’ to that of ‘Empire’.

[The book (specifically in chapters 2-3), discusses the role of the Assyrian king as the deputy of the god Assur on earth, linking the **legitimation of political power** to the Assyrian religious beliefs.]
