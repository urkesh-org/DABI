TO religion; philosophy; destiny; fate 

In this book, the author retraces the paths towards the construction of some modern concepts belonging to Western philosophy and related to speculation on religion. More in detail, Cornford addresses some topics also discussed in the volume “When on High the Heavens…”: the concept of **destiny** and **fate**, the **relationship between gods, nature, and soul**, and their interpretation through the spectrum of philosophical, scientific, and mystical traditions.
      
[With regards to G. Buccellati’s volume, it is interesting a consideration expressed by the author in the *Praface*, p. v, about the interpretation of natural and religious phaenomena in pre-classical times on the base of mythological accounts: <<The modes of thought that attain to clear definition and explicit statement in philosophy were already implicit in the unreasoned intuitions of mythology>>. The author recognizes that later philosophical speculations on religious phaenomena were already present also in ‘pre-philosophical times’, specifically in the realm of **mythological intuitions**.]
