The personal pronouns in Hamito-Semitic occur in two main sets: subject and genitive- object 
(rather than separate and suffix). The two sets are different in the stems, but parallel in the patterns 
used. Various points of detail arel made, especially for Cushitic and Egyptian, in the attempt to foster 
a historical understanding of the Akkadian system. Some of the conclusions relevant for Akkadian:
vocalic uniformity in the set of subject prefixes ('aprus, taprus, etc.) goes back to common Hamito-
Semitic (p. 10); n as a plural marker in the set of subject pronouns (ninu, attunu, etc.) also goes back to 
common Ham.-Sem. (23, 35); t used for the subject set, and k for the genitive-object are the result of a 
special development in Semitic (33); the dative marker &#352;, peculiar to Akkadian within Semitic, is also 
attested in Cushitic (36). -Verbal roots are built on the pattern CCVC, nominal roots on CVCVC: 
the latter, more "static" in semantic value, are probably original over the verbal roots, which are 
"dynamic." The vocalism of the last syllable has semantic value: u stresses the subject agent and is appropriate 
for intransitives; a expresses the connection between subject and object, and is appropriate 
for transitives; i is ambivalent (like the genitive, which can be either subjective or objective). As for the 
tenses, Proto-Sam, had a two aspect system consisting of imperative (iprus) and perfective (paris), to 
which Akkadian added present (iparas) and perfect (iptaras). The "ventive" mood is understood, on 
the basis of Cushitic, as expressing emhasis or special interest on the part of the speaker. The 
permansive is close to the nominal conjugation of Cushitic, Hamitic and Berber, and is therefore common 
Ham.- Sem.; in Akkadian it provides a mechanism for activating nouns by giving them verbal 
dy?namis, while remaining at the same time independent of and outside the proper system of tenses. 
The conjugation system of Akkadian is closest to Proto-Sem. The description of the semantic value of 
the stems is based on the notion of various degrees of verbal dy?namis (for this concept see pp. 43,47, 
73, 92, 124ff.). (See EDZARD 1964; VON SODEN 1965).
