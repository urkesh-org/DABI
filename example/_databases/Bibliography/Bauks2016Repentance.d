TO divine wrath; repentance; freedom

Author summary: The mythical structure of the Primeval History offers an image of God which seems at first glance to admit a God who repents his acts of formation and world ordering. Gen 2-4 describes, however, a dynamic God, moved, motivated and pushed by needs of human and world. God is changing by acting in a process-related way. Instead of an anthropomorphic notion of God (in the sense of <<repentance>> or <<failing>>), the narration presents God in an anthropo-praxis (<<changing of mind>>) pattern within a narrative function. 

[Bauks' idea is that in Gn 2-4 **God changes his mind several times, to accommodate the choices made by men**. While in the Mesopotamian parallel myths it is the gods who make decisions and change the course of the story (as is somewhat typical in polytheism, the gods are like copies of men), in Genesis it is men and women who do so. God is represented as completing his creation little by little (p. 333) and he thereby **flexibly permits other freedoms to coexist with his own**, and guarantee an order that can last in time.]
