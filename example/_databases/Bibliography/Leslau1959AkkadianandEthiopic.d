Rejects the opinion that Akkadian and Ethiopic formed a dialectal
unity within Proto-Semitic, on the following grounds: the ending *-a*
in the numerals for tens is from an original dual in Akk., but not
in Eth. where the original dual appears as *-e*. The ending *-ku* of
the Eth. perfect is not the same as *-ku* of the Akk. permansive because of the different function of the two forms. The ending *-tu*
of the Eth. pron. *we^etu* is an original copula, and thus probably
different from Akk. *&#353;uatu*. The *&#352;D* stem of Akk. is different from
an analogous form in Eth. because the latter is derived from verbs
which lexically can occur only in the D stem. The *tan* infix of Akk.
cannot be compared with the *tan* prefix of Eth. because in Eth. a
root cannot occur with and without the prefix. The Eth. imperfect
indicative *yaqatal* is derived secondarily from an original *&#42;yaqtul-u*
(which became identical with the jussive after drop of *-u*), and
thus cannot be compared with the Akk. present B.
