Elaborates the presuppositions of method on which the author's *Grundriss* is based: a historical presentation, based on a careful check of the primary sources; dialectal differentiation is noted as far as possible, but where sufficient preliminary research is missing (esp. in syntax) one will strive for a certain average. Topics such as the use of the tenses or the meaning classes of the roots are treated in morphology, rather than syntax, to bring out more clearly the relationship between form and function. The final remarks deal with terminology, esp. of the states of the noun and of the verbal system.
