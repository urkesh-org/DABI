TO monotheism; polytheism; Marduk

This article documents the development of several strands of Mesopotamian **polytheism**, which present different numbers of gods and also show the absorption of some lesser gods into more important gods. One example, a short text which lists 14 gods as different aspects of Marduk, was brought to general attention by Friedrick Delitzsch. It <<has indeed every claim to present **Marduk as a monotheistic god**. The deities being identified with him are major ones of the pantheon.>> (p. 198). 

However, this list represents only one opinion in the ancient world, one which did not win out in the end. According to Lambert, <<while the attempts to tidy up a host of minor gods and overlapping among the bigger ones were commendable, this was not enough to adjust a sophisticated polytheism to the reality of nature. And the one attempt to see all power in the hands of one god, Marduk, though now vindicated in principle by a scientific understanding of the workings of the universe, did not win the support which it deserved.>> (p. 199).

TO attributes

Buccellati affirms that each divinity exhausts an attribute.

TO angels; demons

Lambert’s treatment of **angels**/**demons**, which do admit of **monotheism** in the Christian understanding of the term, is at odds with [Smith 2001]({B}R/Smith2001Origins).

TO unity; monotheism; absolute singularity

Buccellati affirms something apparently similar: Marduk represents the attempt to re-unify the fragmented divinity in a single figure, “an order that is based on an extreme and hard-fought differentiation, in which the fragments are re-composed in unity” (17.4). However, throughout his work Buccellati maintains the difference between a **numerical unity** such as this, and the **absolute singularity** represented by **monotheism**. Marduk is the most powerful, the one who summarizes 50 other gods inside himself, the victor over adversarial powers. In contrast, YHWH is the only, the completely other, the uncontested and unassailable lord of all.
