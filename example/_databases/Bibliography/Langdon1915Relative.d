TO 

The pronoun *&#353;a* is not a frozen accusative, but the feminine of a 
demonstrative pronoun, without case inflection, the masculine being *&#353;&#299;*.
The form *&#353;at* is not plural, but singular emphatic, derived with the
addition of the emphatic element *t*. The same element, added to the personal pronoun *&#353;&#363;*, gives the form *&#353;&#353;t*, which is equally singular emphatic. Documentation is then offered (275-81 ) to show that *&#353;a*, *&#353;at*,
*&#353;&#363;*, *&#353;&#363;t* are all used equivalently in the following functions: as demonstratives, as determinatives (with and without an antecedent) and
as relatives
