After a survey of previous literature (pp. 246­
59), the position is taken that the form
*paris,* because of its origin as a nominal
clause, subsumes both "members of the oppositior/ *stative; fians.* or *&#234;tre: devenir*"
(pp. 260-62). Specific examples (pp. 264­
73) are then interpreted to show that *paris*
forms may express "inchoative" action "(e. g.
*i&#353;tu wa&#353;b&#257;ku* "since I settled down" )
"transitive" action (e.g. *&#353;e'am mahr&#257;ku*" I
have received grain") and movement or change
of status (e. g. *&#353;umma was&#299;at* "if she has
gone out"). In addition, since *paris* is
also a verbal form, it subsumes the opposition
*accompli : inaccompli* as well, which is
expressed otherwise by the pair *iprus :
iparras.* With such function, *paris* results
identical to West-Semitic *qtl.* The secord part
of the study adduces examples to show (l) that
*iprus : iparras* are to be differentiated
only according to aspect, not tense (hence
Haldar denies the existence of a perfect with
*t*, p. 46), and (2) that the correlation .
*accompli: inaccompli* obtains also for the
*iprus: iparras* of verbs of condition without
necessarily being ingressive, e.g. *ul iballut*
"he shall not remain alive," p . 36. See for
the whole study the sharp criticism by Von
Sodan 1964 ("Zu Haidar").
