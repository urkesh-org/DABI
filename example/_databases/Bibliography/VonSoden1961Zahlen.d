The ending *-a* of the numerals from 30 to 90 (type *ham&#353;&#257;* "fifty") is not a dual but rather the plural of the absolute state. The reasons are: (l) *-&#257;* is used for oblique cases as well as for the nominative (and the oblique of the dual is in *-&#275;n*;) (2) the construct state has plural ending (e.g. *ham&#253;assun&#363;*), rather than dual (*&#42;ham&#252;at&#257;&#252;un&#363;*). General conclusions: (1) proto-Semitic numerals for tens had distinction for gender (since some languages, like Akkadian, specialize the feminine, others the masculine); (2) the absolute state goes back to Proto-Semitic.
