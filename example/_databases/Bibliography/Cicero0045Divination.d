TO magic; divination

Cicero presents many arguments in favor of his central thesis, that **gods exist, care for humans, and provide indications about future events that can be discerned through various techniques**. His major evidence lies in the observations collected over the course of many years in many different places, that in his opinion show underlying consistency and evidence that authentic predictions took place. A **pattern** develops in time. <<If a sow should form the letter A on the ground with its snout, surely on that basis you couldn’t think that Ennius’ Andromache could be written by it?>> (23) 
Cicero is careful to distinguish between knowledge of the fact that foreknowledge has occurred, and the possible causes of it. He does not investigate the latter, whereas he presents hundreds of examples of the former.
Divination is to be distinguished from other technical foreknowledge: <<Doctors, pilots, and also farmers all sense many things in advance, but I call none of them ‘divination’>> (111) 
Error is possible; <<although many things deceive those who evidently divine the future by means of art or conjecture, nonetheless divination exists; but human beings can make mistakes in this art as in every other.>> (123)
