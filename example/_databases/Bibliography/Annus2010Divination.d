<<The study of **signs**, portents observed in the physical and social worlds indicating the will of supernatural agents and the course of future events, was undoubtedly important in all ancient cultures. The first written evidence for a concept of signs, however, comes from cuneiform texts of ancient Mesopotamia. The study of signs from gods was vitally important for ancient Mesopotamians throughout their history. … Subsequently, consulting the will of gods is a well-attested practice in ancient Mesopotamia, accompanying every significant political or private action or undertaking.>> (from editor’s *Introduction* on p. 1) 

[This volume collects many contributions regarding ancient Mesopotamian divinatory practices, aiming at grasping an interpretation of signs which were considered as a manifestation of gods’ will.]
