TO Euphratic

<<It will be argued that the cuneiform writing system, the Sumerian and Akkadian lexicon, and the
place names of Southern Mesopotamia preserve traces of an early Indo-European language, indeed the earliest by more than a millennium. Furthermore, this evidence is detailed and consistent enough to reconstruct a number of features of the proposed Indo-European language, **Euphratic**, and to sketch an outline of Euphratean cultural patterns>> (author’s abstract on p. 156).

[The existence of an alleged Euphratic linguistic phase, suggested by some scholars as an antecedent of Sumerian in Southern Mesopotamia, is still quite debated. The author argues in this paper that some terms of the Sumerian lexicon could be derived from this language, or at least, an influence of the latter on the development of the early cuneiform writing (both as pictograms and phonetic signs).]
