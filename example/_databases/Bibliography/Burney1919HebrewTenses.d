An interesting and lucidly written article, in which the author defends, esp. against Barth, the 
derivation of the WSem. perfect from the AKK. permansive, on the grounds of formal correspondences 
not only in B (204 f.), but especially in the derived stems (206 f.). The permansive is the combination
of an adjective with stative meaning plus a pronominal suffix, or a nominal sentence which, if the pronoun 
is suffixed, "becomes a verb" (205); ; if the predication of the state expressed in the adjective is 
limited to particular circumstances, it t may become active (207). A review of the main usages of the 
lu&. Apart from the rare active usage, the permansive is normally used to express timeless state,
whereas the preterite is used to denote "the emergence of an event into being out of a preceding condition," 
hence the greater frequenct of the preterite in narratives where "events involving action are 
naturally pictured as coming into being out of a fixed point in time" (209). The rest of the article, dealing 
primarily with Hebrew, objexts to the use of the notions of perfect and imperfect, instead of those 
here suggested of condition and action, and suggests to adopt (for Hebrew) the terminology of "aorist" 
for perfect and "subsequent" for imperfect.
