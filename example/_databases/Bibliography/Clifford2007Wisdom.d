TO Mesopotamian and Israelite wisdom

<<The last fifty years have seen a dramatic increase of interest in the **wisdom literature of the Bible**, as scholars have come to appreciate the subtlety and originality of Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes as well as of Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon. Interest has likewise grown in the wisdom literatures of the neighboring cultures of Canaan, Egypt, and especially **Mesopotamia**. To help readers understand the place of biblical wisdom within this broader context, including its originality and distinctiveness, this volume offers a rich collection of essays by distinguished Assyriologists and biblicists on the social, intellectual, and literary setting of Mesopotamian wisdom; on specific wisdom texts; and on key themes common to both Mesopotamian and biblical culture. Scholars, pastors, and laity will find these essays both fascinating and enriching.  Contributors to the volume include Paul-Alain Beaulieu, Richard J. Clifford, James L. Crenshaw, Edward Greenstein, Victor Avigdor Hurowitz, Karel van der Toorn, and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen>> (editor’s presentation of the book on [Brill webpage](https://brill.com/view/title/12841)).

[The volume is a perfect example of comparative approach in analysing wisdom literature in Israel and Mesopotamia. Specific contributions within this book (such as {B}R/Beaulieu2007Wisdom) are better described in other entries on this page.]
