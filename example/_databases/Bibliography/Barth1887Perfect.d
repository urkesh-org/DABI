The Akkadian "present" ika&#353;Vd is historically the result of two distinct Proto-Semitic forms. (1) When the final vowel is the same as that of the preterite is&#353;Vd, it is related to the original imperfect, and is therefore parallel to Ethiopic *janeger* (p. 383f.). (2) When the final vowel is a, it is derived from the Proto-Semitic perfect: the occasional lengtherning of the middle radical is due to stress (p. 380, n.1), and prefixation, instead of suffixation, is due to analogy with the first type of present, i.e. the one related to Ethiopic (p. 385). The documentation (pp. 379-83) is aimed at showing that the vocalization of present/ preterite in Akk. is the same as that of perfect/ imperfect in other Semitic languages. By way of introduction (p. 375f.), the view that the Semitic perfect is represented by Akk. permansive is refuted on grounds that the permansive has different functions and that it can be formed from substantives.
