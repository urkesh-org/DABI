The vocalic element is an essential part of the Semitic root, and
among the consonantal elements one observes an incompatibility which
excludes the cooccurrence of identical or related consonants in given
positions. This exclusion of given phonemes as the result of positional factors creates a greater "expenditure" than would seem allowed
by the law of economy; the same emerges from the consideration that
roots tend to be differentiated not just by one, but by two elements,
e.g. root vowel and final radical in *i&#353;ruk* "he donates" vs. *i&#353;riq*
"he stole" [these are the type of data emphasized later in general
linguistics by information theory.]. In the case of roots with similar meaning and only a slight difference in phonemic structure
(e.g. *p&#353;r* ~ *ptr*) one may assume that meaning nuances were expressed
by phonological nuances raised to the status of phoneme [it is here
perhaps that the term and notion of phoneme enters Akkadian grammar];
this process explains the richness of the Semitic consonantal inventory. In morphology, there is a basic difference between verbal and
nominal root; the latter, historically earlier than the verbs, is
characterized e.g. by a continuans (normally *l*, *m*, *n*, *r*) in second or
third position of *pars*, *pirs*, *purs*.
