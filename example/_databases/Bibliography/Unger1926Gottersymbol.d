TO gods’s symbols

This entry in the *Reallexikon der Vorgeschichte* investigates the meaning of **symbols related to gods** in ancient Mesopotamia, describing the different typologies of symbols, and analysing the mechanisms behind the association of a specific ‘symbol X’ to a definite ‘god/goddess Y’, sometimes on the base of the principle *similia similibus*, according to which features of a specific god are retrieved in a natural or abstract entity or phenomenon (and vice-versa): e.g. Shamas, the sun-god is connected to justice, because his rays illuminate the world and make it possible to discern between justice and injustice.
