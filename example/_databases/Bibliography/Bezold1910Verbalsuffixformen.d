The discovery of a set of dative pronominal suffixes by BERTIN 1885 "Pronouns" has gone unnoticed, but the abundance of such forms in the newly discovered OB texts proves beyond doubt the validity of his insight. A careful survey of the data is given on pp. 4-14, with exemplification divided by period and dialect, and adding the independent personal pronouns to the suffixes. Main conclusions: final-m in the dative forms begins to disappear at the time of Hammurapi; from about 1500 B.C. on a single form is used instead of two as in the older periods, namely: *na&#353;i* (for *niati, nia&#353;im*), *kunu&#353;u* (for *kunuti kunu&#353;im*), *ka* (for *ka, kum*), *&#353;unuti* (for *&#353;unu&#353;im*), *&#353;inatu* (for *&#353;inati, &#353;ina&#353;im*). On this basis, several dozens of texts from Assurbanipals's library are considered as copies of texts dated either before or after 1500 B.C.
