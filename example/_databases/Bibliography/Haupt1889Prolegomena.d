Brief survey of the corpus of texts then available. Linguistic features common to Assyrian and Ethiopic, e.g. absence of an article, present tense, ending *-&#257;ni* for the plural, ending *-ku* for the first person sing of the permansive, vocalism *i* in the last syllable of the pret. D, emphatic and copulative *-ma*, Lexical items; as a result, Ethiopic is considered closest to Assyrian of all Semitic languages. Special peculiarities of Assyrian in distinction from other Sem. languages include the loss of *w*, *y*, *h*,*c*, the different uses of the tenses of the verb, presence of a sibilant in the causative and the pronom. suffixes of third person, the *tn* stem, the realization *napras* with a labial in the root, and lexical items. The article ends with some remarks on phonology and on the continuity of the literary language.
