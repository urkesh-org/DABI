In this contribution, Geertz aims to define religion from a cultural standpoint. Thus, he provides at first his definition of "culture" and "religion" - the first being <<an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life>> (p. 89). Religion is then defined as **<<(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic>>** (p. 90).
At the core of this definition is the idea that religion consists of a set of interrelated (elsewhere referred to as "sacred") symbols that fuse an ethos, i.e. a set of <<powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations>>, with a world view, i.e., a set of <<conceptions of a general order of existence>>.

In order to explain why men create religious symbols, Geertz looks at the kinds of problems that religion aims at solving for people; with regards to the "problem of evil", he maintains that men formulate, by means of religious symbols, <<an image of such a genuine order of the world which will account for, and even celebrate, the perceived ambiguities, puzzles, and paradoxes in human experience.>> (p. 107f).

Geertz also provides a definition for ritual: **<<a consecrated behavior>>** in which **<<the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world>>** (p. 112). And he stresses that it is in ritual, especially in its more elaborate and public forms, that ethos and world view can best be observed by an external observer. According to Geertz, while we cannot perceive the world exactly as it is perceived by the believer, one can still study how the believer uses symbols thus gaining an idea of how a religion is understood by its adherents.

Finally, Geertz highlights how <<religion is sociologically interesting not because it describes the social order, but because, like environment, political power, wealth, jural obligation, personal affection, and a sense of beauty, it shapes it>> (p. 119).

[20 years after the publication of this volume, Geertz's view has been challenged by Asad in his article "The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category" ({B}R/Asad1993ReligionAnthropologicalCategory)]
