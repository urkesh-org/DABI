This volume retraces the paths in the development of the concept of **religion** in ancient Mesopotamia, from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC. 

An *Epilogue* (pp. 221-240) offers an overview on the second-millennium main religious **achievements** and provides the reader with some glimpses on later first-millennium religious developments.

[Note that some positions taken by the author, specifically in defining the concept of ‘religion’, are different from G. Buccellati’s ones. Notes to specific chapters discuss these different views.]
