TO development of religion; Mesopotamian religion; Mesopotamia gods; heroes; epic texts

This volume retraces the paths in the development of the concept of **religion** in ancient Mesopotamia, from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC. 

An *Epilogue* (pp. 221-240) offers an overview on the second-millennium main religious **achievements** and provides the reader with some glimpses on later first-millennium religious developments.

[Note that some positions taken by the author, specifically in defining the concept of ‘religion’, are different from G. Buccellati’s ones. Notes to specific chapters discuss these different views.]

TO religion

<<By **religion** I mean the codification of the interaction with an absolute that remains empirically unknown, but is nevertheless empirically assumed. It is an absolute because our perception of things is conditioned by it in ways that are beyond our control. An empirically unknown absolute because it totally eludes all physical and tangible parameters>> (Buccellati, §1.1). This definition of religion is quite different from others, e.g. that in {B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures, who considers religion as a response of the human beings to a specific need, thus avoiding any relationship with the ‘absolute’.

TO Mesopotamian religion

On the comparison of Biblical religion with the Mesopotamian one, see the introduction to religion and religious practices in ancient Mesopotamia in {B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures, describing the notion of religion in Mesopotamia, the pantheon, and displaying the main mythological texts from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC.

TO Mesopotamian religion

Buccellati describes Mesopotamian religion as <<a system of perceptions and interactions that are historically documented for specific times and places, from which a central fulcrum of spirituality can be deduced>> (§2.7). This feature of Mesopotamian religion led people to a cultural sharing of identity and solidarity, to cohesion and mutual exchange. Buccellati also recognizes that in Mesopotamian religion there are at the same time a ‘temporal coherence’ and a ‘substantial development’, meaning that Mesopotamian religion needs to be analysed both synchronically and diachronically. A similar topic is discussed in {B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures, where the author stresses how Mesopotamian religion must be investigated in its historical development.

TO gods’ attributes

<<But seen in these terms, our perception of things is rather superficial. On closer inspection, what happens with Mesopotamian deities is that each individual identifies with a single attribute and excludes the others. The god of wisdom, Ea, is is univocally identified with that quality, and does not embody love, justice, and so on. The same is true for the goddess of physical love (Ishtar), the god of justice (Shamash), and so on>> (Buccellati, §3.6). The author stresses here how Mesopotamian gods where usually identified with specific attributes. About the identification of specific attributes with specific gods/goddesses, see entry {B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures. Nevertheless, it is to be remarked that these features are not univocal, since the same attribute can be assigned to different gods.

TO plurality of the divine

<<I do not want to propose a catalog of names and attributes here, but rather the question of the relationship between the plurality of divine beings and the absolute. We will therefore consider deities as aspects of the absolute, so that we arrive, paradoxically, at the concept of a relativized absolute, i. e. a composite absolute that derives its unity from the dynamic interaction of its own constituent parts>> (Buccellati, §5.1). The plurality of Mesopotamian divine beings is also investigated in {B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures, especially in Chapter 4 (pp. 93-144): the author insists on the metaphor of gods as ‘rulers’, presenting individual divine figures, paired to specific issues or attributes. Nevertheless, Jacobsen diverges from Buccellati’a idea on the ‘absolute’, since he did not recognize in Mesopotamian religion a similar concept, considering Mesopotamian religion as a *summa* of singular gods/goddesses.

TO gods’ attributes

<<ASTRACT IDEAS. -- It soon happened that the gods came to be identified with attributes corresponding to major guiding concepts for human activities>> (Buccellati, §6.4, point 4). About the identification of specific attributes with specific gods/goddesses, see entry {B}R/Jacobsen1976Treasures. Nevertheless, it is to be remarked that these features are not univocal, since the same attribute can be assigned to different gods.
