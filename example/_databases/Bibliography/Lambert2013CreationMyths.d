This volume summarizes Lambert's decades-long studies on Sumerian and Akkadian creation myths. It contains the transliterated and translated text of the Babylonian epic of creation *Enuma Eliš*; an in-depth study of different aspects of the epic in the framework of Mesopotamian religious history (including the organization of the universe, of the earth and of the divine pantheon); the edition of 16 more Sumerian and Akkadian literary texts which deal with the topic of the creation; the theogonies of Enlil and Anu.

Lambert's volume addresses several topics which are relevant for Buccellati's discussion of ancient Mesopotamian religion - topics which are mostly elicited from a careful reading of the Sumerian and Akkadian original written sources. 

Particularly interesting is the issue of the decreeing of destinies and of the Tablet of Destinies. In Mesopotamian literature, several gods are said to decree destinies, either as single deities (mostly Enlil, whose prestige had always been associated with the "determining of destinies" as discussed at p. 257 and 304) or as a community. At the end of the cosmic battle described in *Enuma Eliš*, however, in the newly established order of the divine pantheon "the Seven gods of destinies were appointed to give decisions" (line VI, 81). The same seven gods of destinies are almost certainly meant by "the Seven great Anunnaki" mentioned in *Atra-hasis* line I 5 (cf. pp. 193-194). [Lambert's survey of literary texts related to the "Tablet of Destinies" is relevant for Buccellati's volume, as it describes the ancient Mesopotamian's perception of the decreeing the fate and the concept of Destiny itself].

Lambert also addresses the topic of the ancient Near Eastern concept of cosmology, noting that the idea that originally heaven and earth had been joined, or were closely connected, is very widespread in world mythology. Then, it tackles the issue of the organization of how, after the separation of the two, the realms were organized according to the ancient Mesopotamian perception. The ordering of the heavens as described in *Enuma Eliš* mostly focuses on fixing the calendar rather than in astronomy *per se*: Lambert considers a noteworthy feature of this part of *Enuma Eliš* the fact that the topic is addressed scientifically, with very little reference to mythology (p. 172).

Lambert, then, deals with the organization of the heavenly bodies as described in *Enuma Eliš* - particularly, with the tripartite scheme based on the cosmic locations of Anu (heaven), Enlil (earth), and Ea (Aps˚) as the three main levels of the universe (pp. 196-197). The scholar also notes that in ancient Mesopotamian religion, besides dwelling in their temples deities were thought to have an other-wordly home, above or beneath the world of men; yet, the scheme described in *Enuma Eliš* gives Marduk no other home than Esagil: thus, the city of Babylon could boast a prestige which no other city could match and it became the place in which from time to time the gods from above and below would assemble.

Finally, one of the myths edited in Part III deserves a special mention: it is Enmešarra's Defeat, discussed at pp. 281-298. The story shares many parallels to *Enuma Eliš*, namely a rebellion against Marduk lead by Enmešarra and his seven sons who are then defeated and put into prison. Also in this text, there is a description of a cosmic reorganization. Lambert's discussion of the rather obscure section iv 18-30 (paralleled in v 18-26), deserves to be quoted in full: <<**A voice cries from heaven with fateful announcements.** It is paralleled more easily in the Bible and the Rabbinic bath qÙl than in cuneiform. In a monotheistic world, the supreme and only god is of course responsible, but **in a polytheistic world one asks, Whose voice? The only possible answer is that the voice speaks for the Destinies-a set of regulations governing the universe, including the gods**. If any one god had been responsible, this would surely have been stated. Thus, the very anonymity of the voice serves to reinforce the certainty of the matter announced. The first of the two sections states that Uruk and Nippur are to be devastated. These are the towns of Anu and Enlil, and since the author seems to ignore Ea completely, this meant the end of the old Neo-Sumerian trinity of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, so leaving Babylon and Marduk to take over their previous hegemony. Whatever the truth may turn out to be, this announcement is one of the most spiteful passages of Babylonian literature reflecting inter-cult rivalry. The second announcement asserts Marduk's absolute supremacy in the universe>> (pp. 282-283).

[Strikingly, such unique aspect of the myth has not been discussed in detail by other scholars: Lambert's interpretation, though intriguing, is still very doubtful due to the lack of any similar passages in all the other ancient Near Eastern literary texts known so far.]
