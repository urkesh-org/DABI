TO Ancient Near East history 

This atlas briefly deals with the history of the Ancient Near East from prehistoric times to the Roman imperial period.

Each part (ten in total) of the volume is devoted to a specific period, describing both historical events and the geographical and chronological framework of each described timespan.

Parts I and II describe some cultural traits and features of the Ancient Near East, focusing on geography, economy, writing systems, main archaeological sites, and trades. 

In each section, brief chapters are devoted to specific chronological periods; a final *Timeline* (pp. 288-290) helps the reader in having a summarized view on all the history of the Ancient Near East, from ca. 3100 BC (Early Bronze Age) to AD 661, when Damascus became capital of the first Muslim empire.   

[This book is a compact but complete handbook for the history of Ancient Near East and its people.]
