After philological notes on selected passages from *PRU* III, the author points out some characteristics of orthography, phonology (e.g.
*t+&#353;* preserved), morphology (proleptic possessive pronoun before determinative 
pron. as in *eqel&#353;u &#353;a PN*, case endings in the construct state, 
third fern. sing, of the verb in *t-*, reenforced prohibitive with the
present) and syntax (predicate in sentence initial, verbal predicate
in the sing, with subject in the plur., NWSem. use of conjunction *u*).
