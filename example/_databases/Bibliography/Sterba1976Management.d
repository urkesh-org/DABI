<< Ancient Mesopotamians were perhaps the first people to evolve a methodical, disciplined approach to the management of large-scale, complex organizations. The success and longevity of their temple corporations provide dramatic testimony to the versatility and effectiveness of the managerial concepts and techniques which they developed>> (p. 16).

[This paper analyses the many dynamics and **institutions** at the base of the **templar administration system**, defining the different ‘classes’ of people frequenting and maintaining the temple which is considered within its social, geographical, economic, financial, and cultural landscape.]
