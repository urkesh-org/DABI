The patterns used to form ordinal numbers are *parūs* (e.g. *šalultu*) and *paris* {*šalšu*), of which the first one was used for numbers referring to time division. In addition, Akk. uses also the afformatives *ī* (*šamanū*) and *ay* (*šalšay*). The last portion of the article contains comments to the section on the numerals in DELITZISCH 1889 Grammatik.
