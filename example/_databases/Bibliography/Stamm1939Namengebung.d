TO Akkadian personal names; Appendix 17

This volume collects many **Akkadian personal names** (sometimes theophoric) mentioned and discussed by G. Buccellati in his book on Mesopotamian religion, specifically in [*Appendix 17*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/appendices_mDP.htm#17). 

[The book is listed in this bibliography since it is used as the basic reference to Akkadian (theophoric) personal names quoted and discussed in G. Buccellati’s volume.]
