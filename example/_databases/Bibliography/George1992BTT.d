In this volume, George offers a philological edition of Akkadian texts which together make a useful collection of information regarding the Babylonian gods and their cult places within the temple complexes in Mesopotamian cities such as Babylon, Nippur, and Assur. The book also includes many details regarding the topography of Babylon.

While investigating the main text analyzed in the volume, i.e. the one named "Tintir = Babylon", George also discusses relevant historical issues such as the "syncretism" of Babylon and the ancient city of Eridu which took place in the Kassite period, following the syncretism between Enki and his son Asalluhi (patron gods of Eridu) with the Babylonian god Ea and his son Marduk. It is also likely that the description of Babylon included in "Tintir = Babylon" may reflect an idealised record of the city, with exact measurements of its streets, gates, and major buildings, rather than a realistic depiction of Babylon itself.
