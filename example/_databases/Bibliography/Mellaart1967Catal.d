This volume describes the main archaeological results of the excavation undertaken by James Mellaart in the ancient Anatolian site of [Çatal Hüyük](http://www.catalhoyuk.com/). Already in the **Neolithic** period, people living at Çatal Hüyük developed a typical **funerary custom**: dead were buried inside houses under benches along the walls of the dwelling place. This connection between the world of livings and the world of dead entangles a specific conception of cultic places: at Çatal Hüyük, there are no traces of temples, which will develop later in Southern Mesopotamia, with the first Sumerian cities, such as Uruk (see e.g. {B}R/Liverani2006Uruk); some private houses have been interpreted by archaeologists as ‘shrines’, even if these places lack the basic features of a proper temple.
 
[The book involves some topics concerning the present website: Neolithic funerary customs, the conception of the **first worshipping places**, the basic difference between **villages** (in Anatolia) and the **first cities** (in Southern Mesopotamia).]
