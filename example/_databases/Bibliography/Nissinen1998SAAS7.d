TO prophecy

<<This book is a companion volume to SAA 9, Assyrian Prophecies, by Simo Parpola [{B}R/Parpola1997SAA9]. While SAA 9 presents and discusses the corpus of Neo-Assyrian prophetic texts, SAAS 7 collects, analyzes, and discusses the references to **prophecy in other genres of Neo-Assyrian texts**: royal inscriptions, treaties, letters, and even an administrative text. Nissinen’s work is not a comparison of Assyrian prophecy with biblical prophecy, but rather an attempt to define Assyrian prophecy as it was viewed in its own culture, the uses that were made of it, and how it was related to other methods of determining the divine will>> (from [Eisenbraun’s website](https://www.eisenbrauns.org/books/titles/978-951-45-8079-6.html)).

[The volume represents the source for original texts, provided in transcription and translation, regarding references to prophecy in other genres of Neo-Assyrian texts.]
