From the examination of 570 text occurrences of personal names in
the Akk. texts of Ugarit it appears that names with afformative *-&#257;n-*,
*-&#275;n-*, *-&#299;n-*, *-&#363;n-* are inflected diptotically, i.e. with *-u* for the nominative and *-a* for genitive-accusative. Even though in Akkadian context, the phenomenon is Ugaritic in nature; its origin is perhaps
due to the desire of differentiating the genitive of names in *-Vn-* from the pronominal suffix of first pers. plur. *-ni*.
