TO ritual; cult

In an interpretation of his excavations at the island of Keros in the Cyclades, the author proposes a distinction between ritual and cult, in the following sense: cult, being equated with religion, entails the recognition of individual deities, and ritual can exist without cult or religion (pp. 21-24 and 42-44). The island of Keros served as a «symbolic attractor», one that favored, through ritual, the «convocation and congregation» of individuals from other islands. As such, it is the first «pan-Cycladic» sanctuary, a maritime sanctuary where intentionally broken objects were taken and deposited. The cycladic marble figures may have been the symbol of this «coherent participating community, a koine», or, in fact, the «symbolic representative, the 'logo', of Keros and of the Cycladic community for which Keros was the ritual and pilgrimage center» (p. 42).
