In this article, the author examines <<the evidence of material culture with the attendant degree of inference that seems plausible. The argument is relatively simple: on the basis of the formal attributes of an artifact as we have it today it is possible to establish formal patterns that imply a certain type of operational procedures; these in turn imply a sense of the whole that goes beyond the primary perception.>>

From the observation of patterns of development in stone tools, the author infers the existence of patterns of ordered thought in prehistoric humans. The structure of the tools, the author suggests, can be seen as an example of the development of an ever-greater awareness of patterns in the world, and therefore of ever-greater control of the world.
