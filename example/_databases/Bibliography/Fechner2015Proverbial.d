TO proverbs

The author analyses in this contribution the main features of **Sumerian and Akkadian proverbs** attested in literary compositions of different ‘genres’. The aim of the paper consists in retracing the origin of these proverbs (sometimes deriving from situations of common life), and investigating the historical development of the proverbial literature along the many centuries of the Mesopotamian scribal tradition, stressing common traits and peculiar differences between Sumerian and Akkadian sources.
