TO prophets

This handbook contains many references to figures of **prophets** attested in the Bible and in ancient Near Eastern documentation.

[The volume allows a comparative approach on the figure and function of the prophets, distinguishing their roles according to their specific background (monotheism in the Bible and polytheism in Mesopotamia).]
