TO Babylonian medicine; šurpu (Akkadian)

The volume mainly focuses on the description of **medical practices in ancient Mesopotamia**, including the presentation of divinatory rituals which where sometimes strictly connected to medical practices and spells for chasing away the action of evil demons, such as the ***šurpu*** ritual.  

[The contribution exemplifies how in ancient Babylonia medicine and divinatory ritual were interconnected and were perceived as two disciplines aiming at a similar purpose, i.e. the treatment of patients affected by physical diseases sometimes provoked by demons.]
