TO Tanakh; polytheism; monotheism; canon; Job; Ludlul

The author interprets the book of Job as a four-part text that follows the **major divisions in the Tanakh**: chapters 1-2 echo Genesis; 3-27 engages an "ideological" versus a "prophetic" view of history; 28-31 is related to the Wisdom literature; and the remainder of Job regards revelation understood as a mystical encounter with the living God. "The adherence to the 'living' God means precisely this: that the heavens narrate the glory of the creator, but that the ultimate goal is neither the construct (the heavens) nor the narration (the books), but rather the constructor and the narrator."

This original interpretation develops a central intuition in Quando: that the major difference between **polytheism and monotheism** lies in the perception (in monotheism) of God as an "affecting presence", unpredictable but personal, and with whom a relationship is possible. Indeed, this relationship is more important than any goods to be had from him, even in a state of terrible suffering.

In Buccellati's interpretation, Job can be seen as part of the trend toward the **formation of a canon**, since it treats the individual writings of the Tanakh as parts of a coherent whole. This is a further reason for seeing Job as emphasizing the single human confrontation with God, and the Tanakh as the result of a "single inspiration, translated into a multitude of different stylistic embodiments". This would place the final redaction of Job in the "prehistory of the canon", somewhere in the postexilic period.

In closing, Buccellati also proposes that the connection between **Job and Ludlul** be understood not merely because both texts deal with suffering, but because the main reason for this suffering is God's incomprehensible silence. There is perhaps a hint of movement (in Ludlul) toward a personal understanding of fate itself, "the closest one gets, in Mesoptamian religion, to something that tends, at least, toward a 'mystical' dimension"; in Job, suffering leads to direct confrontation with the Creator. "Creation is not really the final answer to Job's quest; rather, the *Creator* is the answer."

While not common, there are examples of a "Job-like" personality in Babylonian texts too. ({B}R/Buccellati2020Job)

An extended meditation on the book of Job as a microcosm expressing the essence of the Tanakh, especially in the sense that a personal relationship with the Absolute is possible, can be found in ({B}R/Buccellati2020Job).
