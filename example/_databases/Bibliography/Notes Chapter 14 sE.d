TO spontaneous prayers; thanksgiving

Against Buccellati's statement on the absence of Mesopotamian sources on individual spontaneaous prayers, see {B}R/Gabbay2020Thanksgiving, in particular p. 224 in which U. Gabbay discusses instances in which some kind of spontaneous and very personal thanksgiving hymns may be identified in Akkadian and Sumerian formulaic texts, literary works, prayers or related compositions - though the scholar indeed warns that the individuals named in these written sources mostly belong to the elite (high officials, priests and scholars).
