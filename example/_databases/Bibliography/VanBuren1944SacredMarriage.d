TO sacred marriage

The author describes in this paper the nature and historical development of **sacred marriage** in Mesopotamia. After a discussion about marriage of gods and goddesses (as attested by many literary compositions), the author defines (in the second part of the contribution) the marriage of goddesses and the priest-king, while (in the last section of the paper) he investigates the marriage between a god and a priestess comparing these latter practices to the previously described divine marriages. 

[The ritual of the sacred marriage in early Mesopotamian literature is here analysed through a comparison with literary attestations of ‘actual’ marriages between divinities, retracing in these compositions the mythological origin of this ritual.]
