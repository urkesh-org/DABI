TO 50 names of Marduk

<<*Enūma eliš* is one of the few Akkadian texts that are relatively well known beyond the cryptic domain of the Assyriologist. The “popularity” of *Enūma eliš* seems to relate, at least in part, to one of its most transparent themes, namely, the creation of the universe. An emphasis on the etiological aspect of the composition appears already in George Smith’s translation entitled *The Chaldean Account of Genesis* published in 1876 […]. The creation story was thus the means to convey, proclaim, and justify the enthronement of [Marduk](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html) as Babylonia’s main deity. The glorification of Marduk is so forceful that the poet has him take over [Enlil](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/enlil/index.html)’s role as head of the pantheon. This was achieved progressively throughout the text, first by suggesting Marduk’s righteous genealogy, then by presenting him as the hero who defeated Tiamat and fashioned the universe, and finally by granting Marduk **fifty names**. In this paper, I wish to address the structure of the section dealing with the fifty names and its function within the poem as a whole>> (from p. 507).

[This paper helps in better understanding the topic of the names of Mesopotamian gods and the plurality of deities within the Sumerian and Akkadian pantheon, specifically focusing on the **50 names of Marduk**.]
