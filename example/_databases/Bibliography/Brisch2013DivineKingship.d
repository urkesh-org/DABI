Brisch considers the phenomenon of deification of kings in ancient Mesopotamia "a short-lived but nevertheless interesting phenomenon". In this article, she offers a short chronological overview of the most relevant chases from the third millennium BCE.

In the opening paragraphs, particularly interesting because they provide the author's methodological approach to this issue, Brisch investigates how the distinction between humans and god(s) could be perceived in a given cultural context - since divinity is indeed a concept that has been understood very differently throughout history and divine kingship has been adapted and creatively modified to each specific circumstance. As for ancient Mesopotamia, Brisch highlights a relevant inconsistency which may be often found in scholarly literature: «some scholars use the term "divine kingship" interchangeably with "sacred kingship," whereas others make a clear distinction: one refers to the act of making a king into a god (although it is not always clear whether this refers to the deification of kings during their lifetimes or also after death), the other indicates the king’s closeness to the sacred but may not necessarily imply that a king was venerated as god.» (pp. 38-39). After having provided a useful review of bibliographical references on this topic, the author makes it clear that, in her article, with "divine kingship" she refers to the deification of kings during their lifetimes.

At the end of her review of case-studies of divinized kings in third-millennium BCE Mesopotamia, Brisch concludes that such phenomenon manifested itself very differently across cultures: in some cases kings were apparently deified (or deified themselves) shortly after overcoming a crisis or achieving extraordinary deeds), and in other cases deification seems to have been associated with political expansion.
