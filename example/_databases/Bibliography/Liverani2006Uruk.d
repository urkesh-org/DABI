M. Liverani describes in this book the history of the ancient Sumerian city of **Uruk**, stressing its importance towards the expansion of complex societies (based on the city as the center of a system  interrelating the core with its countryside) in Southern Mesopotamia. The archaeological evidence is well documented along with textual sources describing the first phases in the development of writing.  

[This book well exemplifies the historical development from villages to the first cities in ancient Mesopotamia.]
