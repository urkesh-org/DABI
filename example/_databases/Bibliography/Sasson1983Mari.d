The author presents in this paper a discussion of **dreams** attested from documentation found at **Mari**, displaying their basic features and discussing about the different ways of interpretation given by ancient people to these dreams.

[The contribution clearly exemplifies the results of an **emic approach** to the analysis of ancient cuneiform documentation, contextualising the reality of dreams in its social and cultural context of origin.]
