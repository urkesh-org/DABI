This volume collects nine articles based on papers given at a Princeton conference 2007, that had the same title as the book. The concept of "**revolutionary monotheism**" was developed by Jan Assmann (see {B}R/Assmann1998Moses), and in this book it is understood in two ways: «first, it has been proposed that the politics of the Sargonid kings of Assyria elicited "an Iraelite response that directly impacted the God-idea" that would have been "revolutionary" in the sense of being reactionary in relation to another political entity; second, it was considered "revolutionary" in terms of a radical shift in belief systems, fueled by what Assmann calls "the Mosaic distinction."» (p. 11).
The book is introduced by a thorough paper by the editor, "A New Agenda for the Study of the Rise of Monotheism", that presents the conditions for **an up-to-date discussion of the concepts of polytheism and monotheism in the ancient Near East** - thus considering Israel, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Iran.
Egypt is discussed in J. Baines's paper, "Presenting and Discussing Deities in New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period Egypt", in which he stresses the continuity in polytheism in the history of Egypt. Akhenaten's short-lived revolution is proposed as an expression of monolatry rather than monotheism (p. 65). G. Rubio's chapter, "Gods and Scholars: Mapping the Pantheon in Early Mesopotamia", emphasizes that there was indeed no 'single pantheon' in the third millennium BC Mesopotamia - but rather a number of constellations, varying according to city, cult, scribal tradition, etc. 
The following papers by F. Rochberg ({B}R/Rochberg2011HeavensGods) and B. Pongratz-Leisten ({B}R/Pongratz-Leisten2011DivineAgency) have been extensively presented in specific bibliographic entries, thus they will not be discussed again here. The next articles shift the focus on the Hebrew Bible, to begin with P. Machinist's "How Gods Die, Biblically and Otherwise: A Problem of Cosmic Restructuring" and M.S. Smith's, "God in Translation: Cross-Cultural Recognition of Divinity in Ancient Israel" both discuss the process in Ancient Israel that led to what they both consider as true monotheism in the Hebrew Bible. According to K. Schmid, "The Quest for 'God': Monotheistic Arguments in the Priestly Texts of the Hebrew Bible", the Priestly Code in the Pentateuch testifies to a conception of Yahweh as the only deity.
J.J. Collins, "King and Messiah as Son of God", assumes that Jesus is best understood as a purely Jewish character, free from Hellenistic traits. The final contribution to this volume, from P. Oktor Skjærvø, entitled "Zarathustra: A Revolutionary Monotheist?", provides an overview of the Zoroastrian literature and it comes to the conclusion that whatever theological assumptions there may be in these texts these would not be monotheistic, but rather poly- and/or henotheistic.
Considered as a whole, the volume achieves several goals: amongst these, it proves that Assmann's hypothesis about revolutionary monotheism is ultimately not viable (Baines, Smith, Schmid) and it provides evidence that **change was a regular feature even in the more conservative religions**.
