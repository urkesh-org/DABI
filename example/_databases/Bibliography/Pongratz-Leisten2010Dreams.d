The author analyses in this paper the meaning of dreams in some literary compositions, such as the ***Ludlul bēl nēmeqi*** (the *Poem of the Righteous Sufferer*), compared to other literary texts (prayers, the **Gilgamesh Epic**, the **Erra Epic**, texts related to the **Seven Sages**). The author also discusses about the notion of authorship of these texts (and the use of acrostics to hide the name of the actual author), adding some remarks on the tradition of these documentation.  

[The contribution helps in understanding the value and function of dreams in literary composition of different ‘genres’.]
