TO Sumerian religion

This volume is conceived as a useful handbook to the introduction of history and culture of ancient Sumerians. It is divided into 11 chapters (this entry will be focused mainly on the chapters related to religious aspects, i.e. nos. 10-11).

*Chapter 10* involves the Sumerian **divine world**: the author underlines at the beginning how <<Sumerian civilization becomes incomprehensible if the profound religiosity of this people is not put in the right light, even if we do not always manage to perceive the peculiarities of a world so far away in time>> (p. 306). It means, in few words, that Sumerian culture is strongly embedded in religion. The author further stresses how the Sumerian divinities are strictly connected to a specific city, sometimes acting as **polyad gods/goddesses** (p. 306). 

Furthermore, the scholar highlights a fundamental limit to our knowledge: <<Indeed, scholars are fully aware of the difficulty of drawing a picture, albeit summary, of the Sumerian religious beliefs: the lack of knowledge of the material, especially epigraphic, and the tendency of literary compositions, often due to needs of a syncretistic nature, constitute serious concerns an investigation of the Sumerian religion. To these external difficulties, so to speak, there is another of an intrinsic nature: the Sumerians have not handed down theological treatises to us; we must derive their thought and their religious conceptions from the mythological texts, which however are often inscrutable for us>> (p. 306). Pettinato also stresses how the reconstruction of Sumerian religion in prehistoric and proto-historic times is built mainly on archaeological evidence, while from the late fourth millennium BC, textual sources can help in this effort (p. 308).      

*Chapter 11* recounts the **intellectual world** of Sumer, dealing with scribal tradition, libraries, and the different literary ‘genres’. About **religion**, mythological texts, divine journeys, hymns to divinities and sovereigns, and hymns to temples are examined.

[Specifically, on religion, Pettinato underlines the many difficulties in interpreting Sumerian religious thought and the wide limits in our understanding of their **‘theology’**, since no actual ‘theological’ sources have ever been written by Sumerians, and we can only grasp some clues from archaeology or other religious compositions, such as hymns, lists of gods, epics and mythology, emphasizing the following: <<When we speak of ‘epic’, ‘myths’, ‘prayers’, we must be aware, under penalty of misunderstandings about the supporting structures of ancient thought, that we are using terms of convenience which in themselves reveal very little the concept or concepts that underlie the ancients texts (and what little these labels reveal... it would be better if they didn’t reveal it, so much confusion they generate!)>> (p. 373)]

TO Sumerian religion

Taking ancient Mesopotamian religion as a model of study in the analysis of the divine, it is not possible to avoid mentioning the most ancient religious system attested in Mesopotamia, i.e. that of Sumerians. For an overview on Sumerian religious system and beliefs, see {B}Mes-rel/Pettinato2007Sumeri, presenting the main features of Sumerian religion, adding some useful notes on methodology to be applied in the analysis of such ancient culture.
