<<The article contains a summary of sources for the Sumerian composition **Dumuzi’s Dream** that have become known since the edition by Alster (1972). A particularly interesting tablet from Susa published by Durand (1990) with many unusual syllabic writings is edited in its entirety. Two new sources from the California Museum of Ancient Art in Los Angeles are published for the first time, resulting in an improved reconstruction of lines 71-89. Two sources from the Schøyen collection in Oslo are also published here for the first time. One of these adds considerably to the reconstruction of the same part, and differs from the main sources in adding some lines that cannot yet be fully reconstructed>> (author’s abstract).

The contribution can be considered as a continuation of the previous publication {B}R/Alster1972Dumuzi, presenting new sources related to the topic of *Dumuzi’s Dream*.
