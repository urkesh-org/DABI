TO polytheism, phenomenology of religion

The date of publication (2007) can be seen from the printing indications on the last page. It is an edition of course notes written by the author for a class given in 1957-1958 at the University of Rome. In an appendix there is the Italian translation (by P. Xella) of an article by Brelich of the same title, published in 1960 in *Numen*.

The interest of this volume lies in the fact that the phenomenon of polytheism is studied from a phenomenological point of view, instead of describing one or more cultures, although there is a rich and interesting comparative section. The author underlines the fact that the phenomenon had not yet been studied in these terms (pp. 23, 136).
