TO rituals; Mesopotamian art; anthropomorphism

This article investigates the nature and role of the visual arts when they act as either agent or patient in the accomplishment of a ritual. As case-studies, Nadali analyzes several examples of artefacts: royal statues which underwent rituals that made them "alive", statues of gods, and pictures representing human figures (kings, officials, and attendants) as well as human-shaped gods in religious contexts. 

In considering in particular the human-shaped statues of gods, Nadali highlights how these made the invisible (i.e., the divine) visible, and thus properly comparable to the human world. "The real value of pictures and therefore of rituals and, conversely, the real value of rituals and therefore of pictures, is the anthropomorphic codification where the gods are represented as humans and the viewer can take part in the ritual through his body, both in reality and in pictures" (p. 224). Nadali also reminds the highly performative value of pictures representing rituals: indeed, gestures, movements and body positions which had been depicted by the ancient artists aimed to activate the same process of gestures, movements, body positions and emotion in the viewers.
