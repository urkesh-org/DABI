This paper surveys the onomastics of Babylonian women in the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods (from the end of the 8th century BC to the end of the 4th century BC). In the third section of the article (pp. 17-22), in particular, the authors analyze the recurrence of some particular theophoric elements, which allows for an assessment of the roles and statues of several Mesopotamian goddesses, such as Ba'u, Mullissu, Ištar and Nanaya.

Cousin and Watai divide personal names into two main categories, rather than the three suggested by Buccellati in §14.2; their analysis, however, deepens rather than opposes Buccellati's reasoning. With regard to theophoric names in particular, the two authors offer an interesting social and cultural description of the use of divine names for women, also taking into consideration historical and political events which might have had an influence on the phenomenon of name-giving.

From this study of onomastics, they conclude that in the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon was still in force - even after the rising of Marduk, the tutelary god of Babylon, to the head of the pantheon during the Neo-Babylonian period. They identify a sort of antiquarianism which led to the use of theophoric elements like Ba'u, which was common in the "ancient" pantheon.
