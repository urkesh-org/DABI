TO wisdom texts

<<This article presents new editions of three **Old Babylonian wisdom texts**. Text A contains dialogues between different professionals and their customers(?), Text B is a dialogue between a friend and his fellow, and Text C contains several riddles. All three texts are poorly preserved and the interpretation is tentative in many points>> (p. 117).

[The paper focuses on three different Old Babylonian wisdom texts, focusing on common traits and features between them (beyond their different topics and formats): the use of humour, the presence of riddles or enigmas, the teaching purpose of all the texts.]
