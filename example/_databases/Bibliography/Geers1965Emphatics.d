No Akkadian root contains two different emphatic consonants. When such combination would be expected according to comparative Semitics, the corresponding voiceless (only occasionally the voiced consonant) appears. The relative "strength" of the emphatics may be stated as follows: *&#7779;* is always retained, and *g* is retained over *&#7789;*.
