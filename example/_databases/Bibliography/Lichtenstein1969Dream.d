TO dream-theophany; E Document

<<One criterion employed in isolating the **E document** from the rest of the pentateuchal narrative is the characteristic use of **dream-theophanies** as a medium of divine revelation>> (p. 45).

[The author, after a discussion on dream-theophanies in the E document, tries to better understand this <<medium of divine revelation>> through a comparative approach analysing Mesopotamian text reporting theophanic dreams.]
