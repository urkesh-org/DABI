A clarification of the concept of pattern, with a study of its alterations as due especially to 
phonological change. The author points out various phonological encroachments upon the morphological 
system ("le triomphe de la phone?tique sur la grammaire," p. 83), whereby the unity of the 
pattern as carrier of meaning is broken, and the pattern is split into combinatory variants (see esp. p. 
79). Most examples are from Arabic and Northwest Semitic.
