Beginning with a royal inscription from Gudea, thrones belonging to many gods were worshipped in temples during every period of Mesopotamian history. This article discusses the **importance of divine thrones in Mesopotamian religious imagery** and how this cultic practice can elucidate understanding of religious belief. Despite being listed in royal inscriptions and other textual sources, the author notes that material culture is the common basis for interpreting religious imagery as textual evidence is limited to de facto statements of name and length of reign (despite some descriptions of throne designs). Citing royal inscriptions that describe the manufacturing of thrones, Arkhipov suggests an investigation to correlate materials mentioned with iconography.

Information from the Old Babylonian Mari archives mentions a throne dedicated to Dagan of Terqa was constructed during the reign of Zimri-Lim. In addition to a letter from Zimri-Lim's secretary, the throne is mentioned in two letters and 16 accounting documents from Mari - all of which describe the illustrious manufacturing process and raw material materiality of the throne with emphasis on gold, silver, and precious stones used. The letter cites seven goldsmiths tasked with construction, four mentioned by name, all of whom are known from other accounting documents detailing the processes of their manufacturing and the corresponding information with respect to materials used. Arkhipov offers a hypothetical sketch of how the throne may have looked in accordance with descriptions made from texts where the throne of Dagan is mentioned, in addition to correlations made from iconography.

The article sheds light on throne construction and the relevance to religious iconography. Arkhipov lists the Akkadian names given to significant materials used in the construction of thrones. His methodology utilizes text and material culture to reproduce a hypothetical sketch.
