The focus of this contribution is firstly on the peculiar role of [**Urkesh**](http://urkesh.org) (from, at least, the third millennium BC) as a Hurrian **religious centre**. 

After having completed the building of the Excavation House (*paragraph 1*), the [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) team (joined by some members of the [DOG](http://www.orient-gesellschaft.de)) aimed in this season to better investigate and clarify the ethnic valence of Urkesh’s **sacral and political spaces**: the **Temple Terrace** (together with the [***ābi***](http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm)) and the [**Royal Palace**](http://urkesh.org/pages/037a.htm), respectively (*paragraph 2*); the Temple Terrace, composed by the main High Temple ([**Temple BA**](http://urkesh.org/pages/037b.htm) of [**Kumarbi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumarbi) and the vast open [**Plaza JP**](http://urkesh.org/mz/a/JP/ugr/-frame.htm) were strictly linked to the Royal Palace and the *ābi*, with a progressive shifting of political importance from the temple to the palace, which was probably abandoned in a later time when a settlement (represented by private houses) developed on the top of the palace area.
 
Two aspects regarding *ābi* must be underlined: 1) the presence of some **rituals** similar to the ***kispum*** ceremony attested in Mesopotamian texts and 2) the attestation of practices of **secondary burial**. *Sub-paragraph 5.5* describes the stratigraphic sequence of the *ābi*, situated in area A14, along the southern wall of the service wing AK of the Royal Palace AP (see [Plan](http://Urkesh/website/images/PALACE_SECTORS.jpg)) and interpreted as a **necromantic structure** introduced by an access equated to a **KASKAL.KUR**.

*Paragraph 7* offers new insights into Urkesh’s **history**: *sub-paragraph 7.1* focuses specifically on **Temple BA**, whose construction started in ED III.
