This contribution publishes some Mesopotamian **šà.zi.ga** texts, specific **potency incantations**. Some of these texts are mentioned by G. Buccellati in his book on Mesopotamian religion, specifically in [*Appendix 14*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/appendices_mDP.htm#14). 

[The book is listed in this bibliography since it is used as the basic reference to šà.zi.ga texts in G. Buccellati’s volume.]
