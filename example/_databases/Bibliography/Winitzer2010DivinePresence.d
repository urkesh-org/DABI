The starting point of this article is the basic assumption that Mesopotamian diviners confidently practiced their queries in the strong belief that the divine's manifestation would have taken place via one of the various divinatory channels: the divine presence, thus, would have been 'embodied' in the examined media, in the form of some sort of sign. Winitzer, however, also notes how looking at the omen collections from ancient Mesopotamia the mentioning of deities is almost absent.

He thus analyzes such apparent discrepancy, at first by discussing the conceptual setup of Mesopotamian divinization and then by considering in particular the practice of lecanomancy (i.e. the divinatory method which studies the configuration of oil poured in water). He maintains that in ancient Mesopotamia the entire extispicy event parallels the idea of revelation and transmission of the divine word from the god(s) to a selected group of people. Thus, if one accepts the premise that Mesopotamian diviners could indeed identify signs sent by the god(s) via extispicy, then logically it follows that divination was a source of revelation in itself.

In the lecanomancy practice, in particular, the divinatory corpus contained a considerable number of individual entries which aimed at asking about the "presence" of particular deities. Winitzer, thus, asks: <<How to interpret apodoses professing a particular god's "presence"? Can one justly speak of these as conveying an early sort of what later theological reflection might label an epiphany?>> (p. 185)

In the end, Winitzer confirms that the reality of the presence (or absence) of a given sign was equated with the theological metaphor of divine presence or abandonment.
