The commentary to a new transliteration and translation of EA 82 contains important grammatical observations on Canaanite Akkadian, such as the pleonastic use of the negative in coordination, feminine singular verb agreeing with a masculane plural subject, use of the permansive as a perfect and use of the waw consecutive.
