TO Atrahasis

A recent and updated Italian translation of the well-known Akkadian [**epic of Atrahasis**](https://www.ancient.eu/article/227/the-atrahasis-epic-the-great-flood--the-meaning-of/).

The author, after an *Introduction* presenting the topic, the history of the findings, and the core themes of the text, offers the Italian translation and comment of different *recensiones*: the Paleo-Babylonian, the, Middle-Babylonian, the Neo-Assyrian, the Neo-Babylonian, and finally the Achaemenid one, showing how this story benefited of a great and wide success in ancient Mesopotamian tradition (also in the philological meaning of this term).

A final synoptic table and an index of the divine names are presented at the end of the volume.    

[The publication provides for the first time a faithful Italian translation of the epic of Atrahasis. It is included in this bibliography also because it represents, as far as I am aware, the most recent translation and commentary of this text.]
