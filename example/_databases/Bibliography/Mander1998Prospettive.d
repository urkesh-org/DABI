(1) A good summary of Eliade's contributions to the study of Mesopotamian religion, in particular the symbolic value of stone (as furnished with life), of metals and metallurgy, to the search for "a metaphysical thought, expressed in 'figured' forms" (p. 224). (2) Juestin, Van Dijk and Alster are the three scholars which Mander shows to be close to Eliade, in particular regarding the religious meaning of fate (with reference also to the *me*) and the cyclic nature of thought. The section on Van Dijk is particularly interesting. (3) As an example of a personal application of Eliade's thought to Mesopotamian religion, Mander develops an analysis of water symbolism with particular reference to the god Enki.
