The author defines ancient mesopotamian religion as the human response to a numinous experience, in particular concerning human fears and the desire to ally one’s self with the gods in order to find security and salvation. He neatly considers four periods corresponding to the four millenia BC.
At the beginnings of the large scale Mesopotamian economy, the fear of starvation of large numbers of people and its attendant horrors (cannibalism, etc.) dominates religious experience. “Man felt solidaric with the powers in nature for fertility and produce and food, on which he depended so utterly, and, feeling solidaric, he did his utmost to help and enhance them”.
The third millenium exhibits a new fundamental fear, war, which denser population made more frequent. The archeological record shows the immense energies expended during this period in constructing walls and fortifications. Poetic laments describe the horrors of war-ravaged cities. The new institution of the king, to whom the people looked for security against external foes, offered a new metaphor that could be applied to the gods, which deepened and extended the experience of the numinous particularly in the direction of “majestas” and energy (Otto).
The author claims that during the second millenium BC Mesopotamian religious experience was further enriched by becoming personal and individual, not only collective. Prayers from this period exhibit a sense of personal guilt and desire for forgiveness, the beginnings of a searching of the heart: “the insight gained in the preceding millennium that the divine stands for, and upholds, a moral law is now bearing fruit in a realization of individual human responsibility. But also of innate human inability to live up to that responsibility.” During three millennia, “human prayer slowly grew from ‘give us this day our daily bread’ to ‘preserve us from evil’ and—lastly ‘forgive us our trespasses’.”
Finally, in the first millennium BC Mesopotamian civilization waned without producing new religious directions. But Israel was a worthy heir, and carried forward the Mesopotamian themes with new richness and depth.
