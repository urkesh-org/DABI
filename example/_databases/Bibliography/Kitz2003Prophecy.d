TO prophecy; divination

In this article, Kitz questions the two categories in which the practice of prophecy is normally separated by modern scholars: namely, prophecy based on "technical/ operational/deductive" methods (such as divination by livers, stars, and smoke), and prophecy described as "intuitive," "direct," or "inspired" (such as oneiromancy). The author's goal is to provide a preliminary working model for the analysis of procedures of divination and, while doing so, she also intends to locate biblical prophecy among other techniques of divination, particularly by comparing the phaenomenon with prophecy as evidenced by Mesopotamian texts.

Kitz identifies one main difference between biblical and Mesopotamian prophecy: while the Hebrew Bible strongly advocates divinely inspired interpretation of heavenly generated signs, in Mesopotamia the emphasis on this is less explicit. «Thus, whereas in Mesopotamia the signs remained divine in origin, their interpretation could be attributed, in large degree, to human skill and to a familiarity with the appropriate documents of divination. This difference in emphasis suggests that the Hebrew Bible may not necessarily dismiss the efficacy of divination *per se*, but rather any human attempt, unaided by Yahweh alone, to interpret the implications of divine activity.» (p. 24).

Similarly to what Buccellati discusses in his volume, also Kitz believes that the contrast between the biblical and Mesopotamian view ultimately stems from the very conception of divinity: if the basic assumption of prophecy is that all divine action causes material reaction, such a fundamental tenet assumes that the god(s) is/are the activating directors of the earthly world, in which individuals can function as their agents. At p. 31 of this article, the author provides a very useful chart that organizes and correlates the several divination methods that were in use in antiquity.

Kitz, with several examples taken both from Near Eastern sources and the Hebrew Bible, discusses the different roles that were attributed to those who experienced the divine stimulus that produced the dream, vision, or words and the individual who deciphered those signs. Indeed, the two functions need not have been performed by the same individual in neither society: being a divine instrument, through whom experiences in dreams, actions, and/or messages were produced, was a possibility open to everyone - but the role of interpreter was the more decisive component process, inasmuch as interpretation could give a sign legitimacy and confirm the divine origins.
