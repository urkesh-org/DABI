TO faith; man of faith

The author begins with a presentation of the figure of Adapa, <<summoned by [**Anu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu) for having ‘broken the wing of the South wind’ (*ša Šūti kappaša ištebir*, 11 f.)>> (p. 61). Adapa’s father, the god [**Ea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki), advises his son about to avoid Anu’s wrath. Adapa presents himself to Anu in mourning garb and the god become favourable to Adapa; nevertheless, Ea also advised his son not to accept deadly bread or water from Anu; however and unexpectedly, Anu offers to Adapa not the bread and water of death, but those of life; notwithstanding, Adapa remembers his father’s admonition and does not accept Anu’s gifts.
 
The author advances five explanations of Adapa’s refusal, and points out that whatever the explanation could be, this is the only Babylonian myth where the phenomenon of **faith** is present.    
On pp. 64 ff., the author moves to compare the figure of Adapa with that [**Adam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam) (see mostly [*Gen.* 3](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P5.HTM)): both Adapa and Adam <<are faced with the prohibition of partake a certain food>>; <<the occasion to circumvent the prohibition coincides in both cases with a temptation coming from a third party, supernatural in character>> (Ea and God); <<both traditions present the culprit as summoned directly by god into his presence>>; and <<a specific similarity which remains to be stressed is the presumed ignorance of the events on the part of god>>.

The author also stresses a basic difference between the two stories: <<The main difference between Adapa and Adam is that the former remains obedient, whereas the latter betrays his trust. In this respect, Adapa calls to mind other Biblical figures>>. Buccellati continues with a comparison between Adapa and heroes of other Mesopotamian stories, sketching the character of **men of faith**, facing specific “tests of faith”: [**Ut-napištim**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim) and [**Atram-ḫasīs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atra-Hasis), compared to [**Noah**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah) (see mostly [*Gen.* 6](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P8.HTM)-[7](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9.HTM)), but also displaying some differences, and with [**Abraham**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham) (see mostly [*Gen.* 12](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PE.HTM)).

Here are the conclusions: <<Abraham too was called … to abandon his land and his home …; his response was given in the darkness and was based on faith toward the divine source of the command -- and thus made him the prototype of the man of faith for a long and lasting religious tradition. … In Mesopotamia, on the other hand, the notion of faith remained much less pervasive than in the Biblical tradition. … They [i.e., all the aforementioned figures] reflect basic dimensions of a religious sensitivity which, though receiving its classical expression in the Biblical tradition, was not wholly alien from the surrounding ancient Near Eastern cultures>> (pp. 65-66).  
       	
[The author presents in this paper a comparison between Mesopotamian and Biblical figures, focusing on the topic of the ‘man of faith’, stressing a basic difference in personal sensitivity: while Biblical figures totally obey to the God’s will, the Mesopotamian ones are more forced by the gods to be persuaded to follow their orders, sometimes refusing to respect their commands.]
