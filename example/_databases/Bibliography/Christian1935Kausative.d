Intensity is the basic function of the D stem, and is explained historically by deriving the morpheme 
from incomplete reduplication: qatal and qat'al (dissimilation) & qattal; it expresses plurality of 
subject or of object, longer duration of the action, greater degree of effectiveness, greater degree of 
concern about something. The latter leads to the use of the stem in a denominative and declarative 
sense, and through this to the causative sense ("concern about the actualization of a verbal concept"). 
Is the &#353; stem, &#353; / s or h/ ' (etymologically identitcal) are "deictic elements referring to the distance," so 
that the stem expresses direction and bias an inchoative meaning (laba&ru "to age" &#353;ulburu "to begin to age"). 
Therefore the occasional overlaps in meaning between D and &#352; are from completely different starting points.
