The first part of this article deals with the four agents of divine wrath mentioned in connection with the Flood. They are enumerated in the Epic of Gilgamesh tablet XI:181-198, as lion, wolf, famine and the god Erra who personifies war, destruction and epidemic. They are suggested by Ea as a punitive option instead of the radical destruction that Enlil provoked by sending the Deluge. They are comparable to the four agents of divine wrath mentioned in Ezekiel 14:12-23: famine, evil beasts, sword, and pestilence. Ever since S. Daiches, scholars argued that Ezek. 14 reflects the influence of Gilg. XI. In the second part, the article analyses the phenomenon of indiscriminate slaughter of the just and the wicked in Ezekiel, or the innocent and the culprits in the Poem of Erra by the wrathful divinity that necessitates the presence of a watchman as a means of grace, so that a remnant may escape the slaughter and destruction. In the Poem of Erra, the role of the watchman against the indiscriminate slaughter by the god of war and destruction is assumed by Išum, Erra's lieutenant. Similarly, the tenebrous nature of the **Yhwh's wrath and its unpredictable consequences** represent some of the reasons why Ezekiel was appointed as a watchman. His task is to warn the people of Judah against Yhwh (Ezek 3:17; 33:7, "Mortal, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, when you hear a word from my mouth, you must warn them against me!"). A certain similarity exists between Išum the intercessor for the Babylonians who tries to placate Erra's wrath, and the prophet Ezekiel who attempts to appease Yhwh's anger against the people of Judah.
