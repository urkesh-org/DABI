The Proto-Semitic independent personal pronoun of 2nd pers. is *&#42;k&#257;/ &#42;t&#299;* (masc./fem.), of which the first one became generalized, in Semitic, for suffix, and the second for independent position; consonantism with *k* for the independent pronoun is found, on the other hand, in "Hamito-Semitic." In Akk. the possessive pronouns are also derived from the independent, not the suffix form of the personal pronoun.
