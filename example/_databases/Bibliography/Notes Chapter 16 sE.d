TO royal images; rituals

Similarly to what is stated by Buccellati in this paragraph, when dealing with rituals addressed to images of Mesopotamian rulers Irene Winter maintains that "religious belief involves a prior acceptance of authority (Geertz 1966:25) and that ritual practice engages power dynamics in the exercise of, or acquiescence to, that authority or its representative (...) religious ritual becomes an arena in which political leaders not only may but must function, if they are to establish and maintain their own authority". Cf. {B}R/Winter1992Idols p. 16.

TO kingship

Besides the Sumerian King List discussed by Buccellati, another interesting example of kingship "descending" from the gods is the Akkadian composition "The seed of kingship": here, Nebuchadnezzar I is represented as the One who has been chosen by Marduk, who (through Marduk) knows the art of divinations, and teaches it to the specialists, his contemporaries.
