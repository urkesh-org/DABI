This paper discussed the function of **prophecies in the Neo-Assyrian period**, stressing their connection to the royal power and the function of legitimating the king’s authority. A paragraph is also devoted to the description of the **Neo-Assyrian religion**, according to Parpola’s thought to which the author adds some critical remarks. The figure of prophets in Neo-Assyrian Empire is also well described in the last part of the paper, supporting the description of this ‘cultic technician’ with many textual sources.

[The contribution stresses the link between Neo-Assyrian prophecies and the legitimation of the royal power of the king.]
