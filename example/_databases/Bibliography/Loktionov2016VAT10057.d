TO Kummā’s dream; VAT 10057

<<This article makes the case for an Egyptian connection in the **Neo-Assyrian tablet VAT 10057**, commonly known as the Underworld Vision of an Assyrian Prince. […] The article also discusses the nature of the ‘Egyptianising’ elements, assessing the possibilities of both purely descriptive and conceptual connections with Egyptian culture, and what this might indicate about the people behind the text. […]. Overall, the article aims to demonstrate that some sort of Egyptian connection was present, although it concedes that its scale and nature are perhaps impossible to gauge. […]>> (from abstract on [publisher’s webpage](https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/janeh/3/1/article-p39.xml?tab_body=abstract)).

[This paper involves a comparative approach between the text of **Kummā’s dream** and Egyptian sources, expanding the spectrum of comparison between Neo-Assyrian dream compositions and possible Egyptian influences.]
