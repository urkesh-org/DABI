Besides general methodological observations deals especially with the question of the verbal system. The present is proto-Semitic, and is parallel to WSem. *yaqtulu* which originally is not a mood, but a tense: the type *ika&#353;&#353;ad* would be a durative, *yaqtulu* instead a punctual present. Traces of both forms are found in Hebrew, the first in forms with geminated middle radical, the second in the imperfect consecutive.
