TO personal names

This contribution is devoted to the analysis of **Old Babylonian personal names**: the author specifically focuses on their writing system, the syllabic values of some morphemes, on aspects of lexicon and grammar, on the connection with Sumerian names, on theological aspects behind theophoric names, on the use of the name of the family god; a paragraph fucuses on women’s names, and two other paragraphs describe the connection between names and occupations of the name’s owner, and the disuse and misuse of names.  

[On the topic of personal names, cf. also {B}R/Stamm1939Namengebung and [*Appendix 17*](https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%2017_mDP.htm).]
