A fundamental article dealing with the basic categories of internal inflection. First, the reality 
of the Semitic root is defended (pp. 119-21): the root is an abstraction, but of the same kind as other 
current types such as phoneme, prefix, etc.; more precisely, the root consists of implicit elements made 
explicit by associative analysis. A differentiation is made between verbal and substantival root. The 
second part (123-4) analyzes the pattern ("sch&#232;me") which is the form or structure of the word (to be 
differentiated from the "theme" which is the word without inflectional indices.) Patterns belong to 
grammar, roots belongs both to the lexicon in their individual signification and to the grammar in their 
system, general form and usage.
