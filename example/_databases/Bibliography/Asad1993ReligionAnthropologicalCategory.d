Asad challenges the category of belief and of religion itself. The author rejects essentialist definitions of religion and advocates an entirely different conceptual and methodological framework from that developed by symbolic anthropology. He is more concerned with power and discipline, and in fact he begins with the assumption that religion and power cannot be separated - stating that <<this separation of religion from power is a modern Western norm, the product of a unique post-Reformation history.>> In order to prove his theory, Asad starts from Clifford Geertz's "Religion as a Cultural System" ({B}R/Geertz1973ReligionCulturalSystem), maintaining that his intention <<is to try to identify some of the historical shifts that have produced our concept of religion as the concept of a transhistorical essence>>. Asad claims that **there cannot be <<a universal definition of religion, not only because its constituent elements and relationships are historically specific, but because that definition is itself the historical product of discursive processes.>>**

He therefore analyses Geertz's definition of religion to prove that <<a transhistorical definition of religion is not viable.>> Asad sees the end of the eighteenth century as the moment in which the very idea that religion is essentially a matter of symbolic meanings linked to ideas of general order (expressed through either or both rite and doctrine) ultimately arose as part of the Christian history. In his own words, from Kant onwards <<From being a concrete set of practical rules attached to specific processes of power and knowledge, religion has come to be abstracted and universalized.>>

Asad ultimately maintains that <<Geertz's treatment of religious belief, which lies at the core of his conception of religion, is a modern, privatized Christian one because and to the extent that it emphasizes the priority of belief as a state of mind rather than as constituting activity in the world.>>
