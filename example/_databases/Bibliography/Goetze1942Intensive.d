An important study on the syntactical and semantic function of the D stem, in which the common interpretation of the stem as primarily "intensive" is convincingly refuted. In a review of the verbal system as a whole, the difference is emphasized between Akkadian and the other Semitic languages, especially in that the Akkadian stative is not part of the verbal system. The conclusion is then drawn that the D stem is derived from the stative of the 3 stem (p. 5), and that its primary function is denominative; more spacifically, when derived from an adjective, the D stem is factitive. Just like the stative, the D stem may be divided into 3 categories: (l) durative, with meaning "to put a person or thing in the condition which the stative indicates," e.g. *tubbum* "to make good"; (2) perfect, "to make somebody have something" e. g. *lubbu&#353;um* "to clothe"; (3) passive, "to put a person- or a thing in the state described by the stative," e.g. *uhhuzum* "to make something fit." Other apparent D forms are in fact BN, e. g. *yu-r&aacute;-n-aid uraooid " he danced."
