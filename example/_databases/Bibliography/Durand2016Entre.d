Durand offers a close examination of the words indicating **fault, sin, regret, and repentance**. He begins by noting that action was essentially referred to humans, as the gods spent their eternity asleep (if possible). <<All lack and all error had to be first of all, or rather uniquely, on the part of humans.>> (p. 377).

His basic criterion for discerning the original meaning of words is a <<translation in the negative>>, of which he offers three examples. For instance, rather than <<make peace>>, the word *salamum* means to <<not kill each other>>. This criterion is then applied in determining the Babylonian concept of sin, which is first of all <<material loss>> in Durand’s estimation. A word often rendered as moral fault, *arnum*, should be understood primitively as a <<stain>> caused by contact with a sacred object.

The words indicating the consequences of an immoral act carry the sense of being the immediate consequence of the action: <<committing a sin immediately involves punishment>> (p. 385). However, the <<sinner>> does not necessarily intend to not commit the same action again. He may wish to avoid the bad consequences, but the actions are not understood as moral or immoral in themselves. 

Durand concludes that the translation <<sin>> of Mesopotamian words is erroneous, and causes a misleading and fruitless search for a corresponding category of <<repentance>>. Before the Christian era, <<if people were afraid...of the consequences of an act, they consecrated all their energy to annul those consequences; they never pose the question of never doing it again. Their acts… are measured by their consequences, not in themselves. A successful action is, by this fact, judged good.>> (p. 388)

TO touching presence

Notice that the <<touching presence>> in Buccellati is literally the god who touches (*lapatum*) the guilty person. (See {B}R/Durand2016Entre p. 385)

TO sin

Note also {B}R/Durand2016Entre p. 387 the <<blind catalog>> of sins that a sinner might list, hoping that one of them would correspond to his actual offense, of which he was unaware. Quite the opposite of a personal relationship in which the partner had been offended.
