TO ‘People of the country’ (‘m h’rṣ) 

Since this contribution is very brief, I offer here a full translation from Italian to English:

<<‘People of the country’ (***‘m h’rṣ*** [؜הָאָֽרֶץ עַם]) is a **technical expression** of the Old Testament which has been explained in various ways, at least for the time before the exile. The most likely interpretation is the one proposed most recently by R. De [*sic*] Vaux, Les institutions de l’Ancien Testament I, Paris 1958, pp. 111-113, 326 ff. [available on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/devauxrolandinstitucionesdelantiguotestamento/mode/2up) in Spanish translation], according to whom the term designates the free population of a state, the **‘citizens’**, by right: see, among the most significant biblical examples, [*2 Kings* 16, 15](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9G.HTM); [23, 30](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9N.HTM); [24, 14](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__P9O.HTM); [*Ger.* 1, 18](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PPF.HTM). This is the sense that is clearly evident also from an inscription of the king of [Byblos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos) Jehawmilk, datable to the 5<sup>th</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> cent. BC, and known since 1869, but integrated for the part that interests us only in 1950; we report lines 9-11 according to the reconstruction by A. Dupont-Sommer in ‘Sem.’ 3, 1950, pp. 35-44: ‘And may give / [to him (= to the king) the Sovereign, La]dy of Byblos favour to the eyes of the gods and <favour> to the eyes of the people of this country (*‘m ’rṣ z*) </> [and favour to the eyes] of every king and every man!>> (p. 77).
