TO prophecy; oracles

The contributions collected in this volume investigate the topic of **prophecies and oracles in Israel and Mesopotamia**, stressing common features and basic differences between these two phenomena: while prophets in Israel were considered as messenger of God, reporting his own words and will, in Mesopotamia prophecies and oracles concerned the private sphere (when a person required oracles about events of his own life) or the public domain (in the case prophecies were interpreted as a curse or a benediction towards the king or the entire State).
