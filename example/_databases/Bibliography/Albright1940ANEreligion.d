TO Ancient Near East Religion; philology; syntactical study; interpretative methodology

In this article Albright stresses the limitations with comparing <<religious literature of the Ancient Near East>>, emphasizing the need for philological reliability. He assigns three qualifiers needed before achieving a legitimate basis for interpretation: decipherment, philological study, and "detailed dialectic and syntactic research". Citing philological developments in **Egyptology** and **Assyriology**, with some advancement in **Anatolian languages**, Albright notes that the study of **Hittite** and **West Semitic** has not yet achieved the same status. Thus, religious interpretation should remain limited as the grounds for <<philological interpretation>> are minimal. Albright also provides concise summaries of philological advancements in **Ugaritic** and **South Arabian**.

Juxtaposing developments made within these ancient cultures, Albright is heavily critical of methodologies within Old Testament studies, often citing blatant disregards by notable OT scholars. Albright directly attacks and illustrates the limitations of <<Hegelianism>>, notably the evolutionist models reflecting positivism as the preferred methodology within the <<philosophy of histories>> prevalent in OT scholarship. Following this extensive critique, Albright goes on to give a systematic analysis comparing <<religious qualities of the Ancient Near East>>, citing **cross-cultural** similarities while also highlighting notable differences.

TO analysis; methodology; objectivity

In seemingly direct contrast to Buccellati's approach of *don't argue in a given field of research with assumptions derived from another*, Albright argues for a systemization of methodology that does not treat any civilization of the Ancient Near East as unique. However, both Buccellati and Albright are in favor of prioritizing a *linguistic key*, free of influence from historical or religious considerations.

TO polytheism; monotheism; conceptions of the absolute

As opposed to Buccellati's conception that the ANE was entirely polytheistic with the exception of Israel, Albright argues the "*recognition of many deities were simply manifestations of a single divinity*", which he states is a form of **monotheism**. He evidences this reality in the practice of syncretism of deities cross-culturally, perhaps without realizing an inherent argument that all religions of the ANE were different iterations of a single tradition.
