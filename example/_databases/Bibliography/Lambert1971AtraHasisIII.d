Defends his interpretation of locative *-&#363;m* as having a comparative
meaning: variants of the same passage in late but well written texts
show *-&#363;m* as equivalent of *-i&#353;* in a comparative sense; it is valid to
give a new meaning to a form (otherwise well attested in a different
meaning) if the new meaning fits best in a number of contexts; the
use of a synthetic comparative in *-i&#353;* instead of a prepositional
phrase with *k&#299;ma* is attested already in OB.
