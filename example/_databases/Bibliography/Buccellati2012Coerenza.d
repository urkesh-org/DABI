The contribution traces the development of the **perception of the absolute** in ancient Mesopotamian culture. It posits that the encounter with the absolute can be fulfilled only through the self-consciousness of the human being, which is embedded in the elaboration of writing systems, at the base of any order and historical perception.

*Paragraph 1* deals with ‘a bond of **solidarity**’ (for which see also [Buccellati 2014](http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm)), developing this concept by means of the so called ‘urban revolution’ or even by means of the previous, first agglomerations of men in groups (i.e., ‘villages’).

*Paragraph 2* describes how the first phenomenon led to the creation of a **‘image of thought’**, mostly throughout the means of the scripture which is the <<visual image of the thought already embodied as word>> (p. 116).

This thought led then (*Paragraph 3*) to the ‘perception of the absolute’: <<The reification of thought throughout scripture corresponds to the reification of reality with polytheism>> (p. 117). The best outcome of polytheism was this, indeed <<to have detected the whole *coherence* of the data of the reality>> (p. 118). The paragraph continues in sketching out the major differences of polytheism with monotheism (for which, see in detail pp. 119-120; cf. also [Buccellati 2014](http://urkesh.org/pages/911-profondo.htm)).

*Paragraph 4* investigates the relationship between the **binomial ‘order and history’**, the latter seen as an ‘organic evolution’, implying different developments all connected to a general ‘sense of order and coherence’ in human evolution.
