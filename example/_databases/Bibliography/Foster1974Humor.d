TO humor in cuneiform wisdom texts

<<This essay has a two-fold purpose: to survey cuneiform texts that can be considered humorous, and to outline, if only in brief, the **social context of Mesopotamian humor**. Whether or not it is true that man alone of the animals is able to laugh, laughter is loss of inhibition, and the man who laughs is at once most human and most himself. The sense of humor revels in the inevitable gap between what is and what is supposed to be: for example, the pleasant delusion of self-presentation and the self as others see it, the reality of the body and the pretense of clothes and scents, ambition as opposed to performance. Humor is aware of this gap, wit expresses it, and laughter is the grateful acknowledgment of that expression>> (p. 69).

[The paper investigates the sense and hidden meaning of **humor in ancient Mesopotamian wisdom literature**, used to convey messages of sageness in an elaborate (and sometimes elusive) literary-rhetorical  way.]
