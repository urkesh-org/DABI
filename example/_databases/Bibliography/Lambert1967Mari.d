Stresses the need of studying the dialect of given regions, rather
than that of texts found in one place but of disparate origin. The
Mari dialect is essentially OB, more precisely central OB, and Amorite influence is minimal, probably no more than in other OB dialects.
The author studies only one feature whidh is typical of Mari, namely
"the equation: *i* + *a* = *&#234;* "; this was a regular contraction, and variant spellings are scribal archaisms. Writings like *an-ne-e-em* represent an intermediate stage between *an-ni-a-am* and *an-ne-em*, indicating contraction, but keeping a spelling with four signs.
