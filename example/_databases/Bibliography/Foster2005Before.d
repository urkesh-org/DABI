TO Akkadian literature

This volume collects the English translation of many texts, representative of the richness of ancient Akkadian literature.

After a general *Introduction* on the topic, including a presentation of Semitic languages (focusing of course on Akkadian), a history of the research and excavations, and the major sources (including a noteworthy paragraph on poetry and prose), the author displays the texts in chronological order (from the Archaic Period, ca. 2300-1850 BC, until the Late Period, ca. 1000-100 BC), grouping the texts thematically.
