The author presents a review of the book by J.H. Breasted, [*Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt*](https://books.google.it/books?id=S-8CnoLpL5oC&printsec=frontcover&hl=it&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), (Introduction by J.A. Wilson), New York: Harper, 1959 (first edition: 1912).

The book collects a series of academic lectures given by James Henry Breasted at the [Oriental Institute](https://oi.uchicago.edu/), Chicago. The wider part of the book is devoted to the Pyramid Texts, followed by a discussion about the historical development of **Egyptian religion**, explaining myths, the evolution of a moral consciousness, the influence of social conditions, and the expansion of political power.

The publication ends with a discussion about the 13<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> cent. BC, a period defined by G. Buccellati as <<an age of ‘**personal piety** and inner aspiration towards God’, ‘the deepest expression of the Egyptian **religious spirit**’>> (p. 101). Breasted also mentions texts which recall very often some Biblical composition, mostly for what concerns the wisdom and lamentation texts, compared with the Psalms.
