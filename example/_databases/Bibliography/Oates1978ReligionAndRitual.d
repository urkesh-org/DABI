This paper deals with the two basic concepts of **religion and ritual**, underlining the reciprocal relation between the two entities. Religion is here defined as “a major 'prime mover' in the rise of civilized societies” (p. 117).

The author then investigates the development of the social concept of religion and its practical actualizations in terms of rituality, starting from the Sumerian, Babylonian, and Anatolian contexts (with some insights on the Iranian area).

Later on, the focus moves to **burial practices**: "If religion is defined as belief in spiritual or supernatural 'beings' or 'agencies', then burial practices may provide the archaeologist with his best clues" (p. 118). The paragraph then offers many examples of such burial practices as they were performed in Mesopotamia and Syria.

The following paragraph is devoted to the analysis of the role played, within burials, by the deposition of **clay figurines**, even crafted in alabaster, both human and animal, found in Mesopotamian graves during the 6th millennium BC; the importance of these finds is stressed as such: "Such objects constitute the category of evidence most widely cited in support of prehistoric religion, but their remarkable diversity undoubtedly precludes any single explanation of their purpose" (p. 120). The author also shows how sometimes these figures are even depicted on potsherds, as the exemplar from Choga Mami displayed on pl. 4a. A description of the so-called 'Mother Goddesses' or 'fertility figures' is then developed, also recurring to **ethnographical parallels** from modern Africa and Christian culture to explain the actual role of these figurines. 

Here are the basic conclusions: "We must conclude that despite some very interesting, at times even spectacular, evidence for what are certainly ritual practices, we know nothing about 'religion' behind them" (p. 122).

; The contribution is particularly relevant for the definition of 'religion' and 'ritual' during pre-historical and proto-historical times
