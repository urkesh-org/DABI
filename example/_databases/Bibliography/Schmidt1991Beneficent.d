<<This investigation aims to ascertain whether or not the Israelites believed in the **supernatural beneficent power of the dead**. First, a lexicon of selected mortuary practices and beliefs is outlined. In the Israelite context, those rites most likely to reflect this belief are **necromancy** and those which fall within the purview of the **ancestor cult** intended to express veneration or worship of the ancestors (ch. 1). Secondly, an evaluation of the **relevant texts from Syria-Palestine** of the third to first millennia B.C.E. demonstrates that a longstanding West Semitic or Canaanite origin for Israel's belief in the supernatural beneficent power of the dead cannot be established on the basis of these data (chs. 2 and 3). Thirdly, an examination of the **Hebrew Bible** demonstrates that while a concern to care for or commemorate the dead might be inferred, neither an ancestor cult nor ancestor veneration or worship in particular can be established on the basis of the available literary (or material) evidence. Moreover, while necromancy is occasionally attested, the relevant passages which polemicize against Israel's embrace of this practice originate either in the last days of the Judahite monarchy or, more likely, during the exile itself. The historical reality which gave rise to this polemical tradition was the threat which **Mesopotamian religion and magic** beginning with the Neo-Assyrian period posed to later (dtr?) Yahwism (ch. 4). Comparative **ethnographic data** suggests that the longstanding absence of the belief in the beneficent dead in Israel and Syria-Palestine might be partially explained as a reaction to the pervasive **fear of the dead**. Nevertheless, once this belief was embraced by late Israelite society, owing to contemporary developments in politics (Mesopotamian hegemony), economics (depletion of resources), and religion (popularity of divination), necromancy, not ancestor veneration or worship, presented itself as the preferred ritual expression of this belief (conclusion)>> (author’s abstract).

The thesis offers, through 4 chapters, many hints to ancestor cults and necromantic practices in Israel, in comparison to other similar Mesopotamian rituals. 

*Chapter 1* introduces the topic of mortuary practices in ancient Near East. 

*Chapter 2* focuses on extra-biblical and Syro-Palestinian textual evidence from the late third to early second millennia BC: *sub-paragraph 2.1* describes documents from [**Ebla/Tell Mardikh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla) (Eblaite king list, offering lists, lamentations, the Eblaite version of the ***marzēaḥ***), also dealing with Eblaite ancestral gods and the cult of the dead, together with the specific role of [**Rashap**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resheph), the god of the Underworld; *sub-paragraph 2.2* focuses on [**Mari**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria)’s documentation, presenting the ***kispum*** ritual (and its parallel with the ***pagrā‘um*** rituals), the role of [**Dagan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagon), the god of *pagrū*, and the cult of the dead unified ***Itūr-Mer***. 

*Chapter 3* deals with extra-biblical and Syro-Palestinian textual evidence from the mid to late second millennium BC third to early Second millennium BC, comparing elements from [**Ugarit/Ras Shamra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit) (Dagan’s stelae, *kispum*-like offering texts, the Ugaritic king list, the Ugaritic version of the *marzēaḥ* and of the *kispum*, analysing the role of the god ***‘Il ’ib*** and of the Ugaritic [***Rp’um***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite)), from [**Nuzi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuzi), and [**Emar/Tell Meskene**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emar). 

*Chapter 4* describes the evidence from the **Hebrew Bible**: *sub-paragraph 4.1* concerns the supposed ‘Canaanite’ origins of ancestor cults and necromancy in Israel; *sub-paragraph 4.2* investigates the extra-biblical Syro-Palestinian evidence of the first millennium BC; *sub-paragraph 4.3* focuses on the **pre-exilic prophetic literature**, while *sub-paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5* deals with the **Deuteronomic legal material**, and with the **Deuteronomistic history**, respectively; *sub-paragraph 4.6* involves the **exilic and post-exilic prophetic literature**, and *sub-paragraph 4.7* ends the chapter focusing on the Israelite [***Repha’im***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephaite).

[The author underlines correspondences (and even differences) between Biblical and Syro-Mesopotamian cultic and mortuary practices, basing on a sound philological analysis of the written sources of both the areas, reaching intriguing anthropological explanations for specific phenomena.]

TO necromancy; ancestor cults

A good example of comparative approach between ancient Near Eastern religions and the Bible on the topics of ‘necromancy’ and ‘ancestor cults’ is presented in {B}R/Schmidt1991Beneficent, where anthropological explanations for some given phenomena enrich the comparisons on consonance or dissonances between the two systems.
