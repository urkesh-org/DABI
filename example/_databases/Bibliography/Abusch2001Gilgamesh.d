TO Gilgamesh; death; Netherworld

In this essay, the author traces the history of the major versions (Old Babylonian, eleven-tablet, and twelve-tablet) of the **Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh** and examines the development of meaning from one version to the next. Abusch discusses the **changing emphases in contents and sensitivity** of the three versions of the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh: in particular, he offers a detailed **analysis of the different reactions of the hero in front of the death of his friend Enkidu**.
In all three versions, Gilgamesh seeks immortality as a human being, and yet he always comes to the conclusion that his desire cannot be accomplished. In the Old Babylonian version, he has to accept the fact that immortality may only be obtained within the bosom of the family, by giving life to children who will represent him in the future. In the eleven-tablet version, he ultimately becomes a responsible ruler whose wisdom leads to the creation of such achievements that will outlast his own reign. Finally, in the twelve-tablet version, he prepares himself to become a god whose reign is the Netherworld itself, and whose task is to judge the dead for eternity.
