TO explanatory proclamation; literature

*Contra* Buccellati's statement that «In Mesopotamia we do not find such a tradition of explanatory proclamation, nor indeed many examples of even simple proclamation» see, however, the last verses of *Atrahasis*: «This song (is) for your praise. / May the Igigi- gods hear, let them extol your greatness to each other. / I have sung of the flood to all peoples/ Listen!» (ll. III viii, 14-19).

Cf. also {B}R/Foster1991OnAuthorsip, p. 31: «Traditing and dissemination of the text are referred to in Erra, the Creation Epic, Agushaya, Atrahasis, and the Assurbanipal hymns both synchronically and diachronically: "all people" are supposed to hear it, as well as succeeding generations in time».
