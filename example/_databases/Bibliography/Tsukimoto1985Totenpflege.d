This rather outdated volume still represent the **reference publications for all the available Mesopotamian sources on the *kispum*, i.e. the offerings for the death and the associated practices**. It stemmed as a PhD thesis defended at the University of T&#252;bingen and supervised by W. R&#246;llig. The introduction deals with aspects of conceptions of death and the netherworld, the first chapter offers a philological analysis on both the Sumerian and Akkadian terms. Then, two chapters follow in which all the available primary sources and contextualized and discussed, with the most relevant texts provided in transliterations and translation and accompanied by philological comments. The last chapter investigates mythological matters related to the *kispu* ceremony, while in the conclusion the author highlights the main implications of the funerary rites for the ancient societies.
