TO Qumran; horoscopes; 4Q186

This volume publishes *in extenso* the text of many scrolls found at Qumran, in the Judaean Desert, particularly part of those found in Cave 4Q.

The parchment scrolls from Qumran include biblical texts of the Old Testament (also apocrypha), sectarian sources, and various other texts including comments to the Bible (the Hebrew Tanakh, but mostly the Torah).

They present sometimes variants to the Masoretic Text and offer a useful insight on the cultural milieu of the people living at Qumran, a very peculiar and specific Jewish group. 

[The volume also published a scroll (4Q186) containing horoscopes, a king of texts unattested elsewhere in Hebrew canonical literature]
