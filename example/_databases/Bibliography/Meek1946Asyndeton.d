The code exhibits an unusually large number of asyndeton clauses. Only a few of these are both grammatically *and* logically coordinate (p. 70);
most of the other ones are logically subordinate. The author offers
a well differentiated notional typology of the latter group. The majority consists of circumstantial clauses, i.e. such that their action
is contemporary with that of the main clause (e.g. "if a seignior presented a field, left a document" = "if, when a seignior presented a
field, he left a document" [ = gerundive "if in presenting a field a
seignior left a document "]), but one also finds temporal, concessive
(p. 57 f.); modal, objective (p. 69 f.), final and consecutive (p. 70 f.)
clauses. From the viewpoint of word order, logically subordinate clauses appear normally *before* the logically main clause in the protasis
and *after* in the apodosis (exp. p. 68).
