TO Pre-Socratics

The monumental edition of the Pre-Socratic fragments collected by H. Diels, with the collaboration of W. Kranz, from ancient secondary sources directly quoting these fragments otherwise irretrievably lost, being attested only through an indirect tradition. The volumes of this edition provide both the original Greek version, a German translation, together with a philological apparatus. This first volume includes fragments from Orpheus (DK 1) to Pythagoreans (DK 58).

For an English translation, see {B}R/Burnet1920Early.
