TO Mesopotamian representation of gods; anthropomorphism 

<<The goal of the doctoral thesis is to clarify the relationship between anthropomorphic depictions of gods and symbolic-attributive manifestations of different gods. Since modern science focuses mainly on the depictions of Kudurru during this period, the impression arises that the anthropomorphic image of the gods did not play such a major role. This work pursues this seemingly unequal relationship>> (abstract on publisher’s webpage; translation from German by mDP).

[This thesis is helpful in defining the different ways of **representation of gods in ancient Mesopotamia**, mainly for what regards anthropomorphic depictions.]
