This article deals with the anonymity of cuneiform literature, citing only two examples; **Kabti-ilani-Marduk** who composed the **Era Myth** (although claimed to be received through **prophecy**) and **Saggil-kinam-ubbib**, author of the **Babylonian Theodicy**. Babylonian and Assyrian **traditional literature** including **omen** and **medical** texts can be ascribed to "successive generations of storytellers and scribes" who have amended, redacted and altered works throughout Mesopotamia's history. Literature is thought to have been buried in **Sippar** during the deluge, and subsequently rediscovered, attributing all authorship to antediluvian sages. Lambert considers the transference of authorship as a form of **ancestry** practice that should be investigated in Mesopotamian literature beyond the "X son of Y" filial relationship ties. Lambert surveys the change in use of ancestral names from the **Babylonian** period to the **Seleucid**, citing significant events or epochs where different names are featured prominently and relate ancestry to gods, cities, and ancient scribes. 
	This article attempts to trace lineage of individuals through **titles**, making it a relevant resource for those interested in the function of monikers, especially in relation to the appropriation of ancestor titles. The latter half of the article deals with **canonicity**, which in the case of Mesopotamia is intimately tied to the antediluvian **sages** and **patriarchs**, who are responsible for the totality of knowledge. Lambert suggests this point presents a parallel with the **Torah**.
