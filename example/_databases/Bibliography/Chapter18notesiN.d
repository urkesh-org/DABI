TO spiritual hierarchy; divinities

Pyrke holds a contrasting view to the comment in her examination of the socio-religious role of myths and epics, arguing that " Despite a rigid hierarchy in favor of the divine, these relationships are frequently close, involving strong emotional bonds. The human/divine connection is not solely beneficial to either party, but reciprocal and often mutually rewarding." See: {B}R/Pyrke2016ReligionHumanity
