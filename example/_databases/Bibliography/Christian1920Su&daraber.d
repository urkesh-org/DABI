Against the traditional bipartition East vs. West Semitic, the latter comprising Arabic and 
"Abyssinian" as a unitary group (South-Semitic), the author isolates South-Arabic within South- 
Semitic, and points to its relationships with Akkadian in the following areas: prepositions, "tenses" and 
stems of the verb. Akk. Present is archaic (and iqattal is the originary form rather than iqatal, p. 735), 
and so is the suffix conjugation, a conclusion which he supports with "Hamitic" evidence. The broken 
plurals, of which Akkadian shows only incipient traits were developed in South-Arabic under the influence 
of Arabic. Akkadian and South Arabic represent the oldest stage of Semitic. The conclusion 
correlates the results of linguistic analysis with data of physical anthropology.
