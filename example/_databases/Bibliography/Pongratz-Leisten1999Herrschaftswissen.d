TO communication between gods and kings

<<This work investigates the various **methods by which king and god exchanged information**: how the king learned the divine will and how he reported on his activities in the execution of that will to the god. The topics investigated include astronomical omens, prophecy, dreams, hepatoscopy, and letters to (and from) the gods as well as other literary forms of communication between the king and the gods>> (author’s abstract on [publisher’s webpage](https://www.eisenbrauns.org/books/titles/978-951-45-9041-2.html)).

[The volume well exemplifies, through the analysis of texts of different ‘genre’, how gods communicated with kings (and vice versa) in ancient Mesopotamia.]
