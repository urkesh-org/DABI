Assuming incompatibility as a fact, the author
wants to show the reasons for its existence.
The usual explanation (difficulty in the articulation of homorganic sounds one next to the
other) does not hold true, because assimilation
and dissimilation could dispose of it. Information theory has called attention to the
importance of acoustic (next to articulatory)
phonology, emphasizing as a result the importance
of distinctivity of utterances. In light of
this, incompatibility is considered as "an
expression of the tendency not to join together
in contact position (1-2, 2-3) phonemes which
are only minimally distinctive" (p. 137).
The root is defined as "a discrete (interrupted)
morpheme of lexical character, formally similar
to a Markov process, and construed negatively by
excluding elements which lie below the level of
minimal distinctivity" (p. 139).
