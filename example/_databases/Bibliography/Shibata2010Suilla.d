TO Emesal šuilla-prayers

This paper focuses on a specific typology of Mesopotamian prayers called from the Sumerian original term ‘hand-lifting prayer’ (Sumerian  **[šu](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0039506)-[il<sub>2</sub>](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0023153)-la**, lit. ‘lifting of the hands’). Differently from other publications on this topic (cf. e.g. {B}R/Calabro2013Gestures or {B}R/Lenzi2010Invoking), reporting texts in Sumerian or Akkadian, this contribution focuses on prayers written in a ‘dialect’ (or more precisely a <<sociolinguistic variety of Sumerian attested for the speech of women or goddesses and of the ‘cantor’ (gala)>>, {B}R/Edzard2003Sumerian, chapter 16, p. 134) called **Emesal**, very often used for religious compositions.
