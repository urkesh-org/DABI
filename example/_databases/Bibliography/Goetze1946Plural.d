After a short history of the problem a list of all OB examples of the plural in *-&#257;n&#363;* known to the author is given. This special plural form is taken to stress individuality, in that it refers either to "some" of the units counted or to all the units taken "individually." His examples are 33 in number, and include the following words: *ilâ€”*, *&#353;arr-*, *b&#275;l-*, *simm-* "spice," *&#257;l-*, *ekall-*, *d&#363;r-*, *m&#363;t-*, *mur&#351;-*, *rugumm&#257;'-*, *t&#299;r-*, *&#353;irh-*, *mi&#353;l-*. The corresponding logographic marker is DIDLI which also stresses individuality. The second main portion at the article is comparative in nature, and shows that the suffix *-&#257;n* of Semitic is used to (l) create concrete out of abstract nouns, (2) mark an individual as opposed to a class, (3) ascribe an adjectival quality to a specific individual.
