Begins with a good and detailed review of earlier work done on the subject going back to HINCKS 1855-56 "Verbs." The main section consists of a listing of strong verbs which are attested with certainty in both the present and the preterite B, with the following statistical results:
|           | trans. |        |  intr. |        |  total |
| *a* / *u* |   54   |        |   7    |   =    |   61   |
| *a* / *i* |   3    |        |        |   =    |   2    |
| *i* / *i* |   16   |    2   |  16    |   =    |   34   |
| *i* / *u* |        |        |  1(?)  |   =    |   1    |
| *u* / *u* |   2    |        |  23    |   =    |   25   |
| *a* / *a* |   7    |        |  4     |   =    |   11   |
|           |        |        |        |   =    | ------ |
|           |        |        |        |   =    |   134  |
On this basis L. suggests that the vocalism is not arbitrary, in that *a/u* is for transitives, *u/u* for intransitives; *a/a* and *i/i* on the other hand, are secondary. The distinction between present and preterite is old, even though both forms may derive from a common archetype through stress differentiation. The distincion in vocalism between perfect and imperfect in WSem. is late, and thus one cannot accept Barth's principle for noun formation that all patterns are derived *either* from the perfect *or* from the imperfect.
