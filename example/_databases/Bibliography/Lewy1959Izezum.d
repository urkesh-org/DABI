Certain forms of *"izuzzu"* may be explained as derived from a weak
triradical *primae y*, of the type *l&#353;&#275;rum*. The alternation of *y* and *n*
for the first radical is comparable to Hebrew *y&#351;b*/ *n&#351;b* and to Canaanite *ytn*/ other Sem. *ntn* (or *ndn*). The infinitive *izuzzu* itself, may
be analyzed as the infinitive Bt from *yzz* if understood as *&#42;izzuzum*
(i.e. &#42; *itzuzum*: *pitrus*, pp. 353; 359); the first vowel in the alternate form *uzuzzum* is due to assimilation to the second vowel. Similarly the unusual OAkk and. MA precative *lizzaz* is to be explained as *&#42;l+itzaz*
(cf. *litbal*), from which one must assume a secondary root *tzz* (as for
*ndn* ~ *tdn* in 0A). Like verbs primae weak, *izuzzu* is essentially biconsonantal.
