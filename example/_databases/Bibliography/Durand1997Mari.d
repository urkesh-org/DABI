TO rituals at Mari

This paper describes, on the one hand, some **rituals attested at Mari** which can be sometimes compared with other cultic activities performed in Mesopotamia; on the other hand, rituals peculiar of this city (or, more generally, of the Syrian area) are presented by the author as specific traits of the local communities influenced by both Mesopotamian and Amorite customs.
