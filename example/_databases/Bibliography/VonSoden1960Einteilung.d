In reviewing recent publications on NWSem., particularly by Moscati, offers methodological and substantive suggestions for reserach in comparative Semitics. Important is especially the idea that certain linguistic elements present in the cuneiform sources of the 3rd and early 2nd millennium should not be attributed to Akkadian, nor to NWSem. but rather to another Semitic language which he calls "Old Amorite": these elements include lexical (e.g. some names of the pattern *purrus*), morphological and perhaps even syntactical features. Ugaritic was probably strongly influenced by this language.
