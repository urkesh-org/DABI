This volume offers a brief introduction to the religion of ancient Mesopotamia. 
The volume deals with many topics, as it is evidence from the aforementioned index: nevertheless, **Chapter 1** (*Preliminary Questions*) is particularly noteworthy in the definition of ancient Mesopotamian concepts of **religion** and its relationships with **magic**), **polytheism**/**cosmotheism** (vs. **monotheism**), and **gods**. As it is well-known, ancient Mesopotamians did not have a precise term to define *religion* and this concept needs to be understood and interpreted through its manifestations, i.e. the **cults** and **mythological texts**. Starting from the prehistorical period, mentioning the [Shanidar Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanidar_Cave) (see {B}Mes-rel/Trinkaus1983Shanidar) and other pre-Neolithic and Neolithic sites in Anatolia and Mesopotamia ([**Göbekli Tepe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) [see {B}Mes-rel/Schmidt2011Costruirono], [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk) [see {B}Mes-rel/Hodder2010Emergence], [Aşikli Höyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%9F%C4%B1kl%C4%B1_H%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), [Nevalı Çori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neval%C4%B1_%C3%87ori), [Allan Çemi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallan_%C3%87emi_Tepesi), [Jericho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho), Ja’adat al-Maghara [near [Manbij](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manbij)], and [Qermez Dere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qermez_Dere)), the author retraces the paths towards the definition of a religious thought, later standardized in the historical period, after the foundation of the first cities in the Syro-Mesopotamian area, underlining the emergence of some specialistic figures (already in the preurban phase), such as the *medicine man* (defined as a **shaman**), and the evidence of early **ancestor cults**. 

On pages 23 and 48, the author also proposes to define the ancient Mesopotamian religion system not only as a **polytheism** but even better as a **cosmotheism**, i.e. a system where deities are perceived as the manifestation or personification of the natural order (*cosmos*) of the world (as for *cosmotheism*, see {B}Mes-rel/Assmann1998Moses). 

On pp. 25-27, the authors also discusses some particular archaeological methodologies (such as [Lewis Binford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Binford)’s [*New/Processual Archaeology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processual_archaeology) or [Vere Gordon Childe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Gordon_Childe)’s [Marxist archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_archaeology)), and theories on phenomenology (as those of [Mircea Eliade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade)), hard sciences, and neurosciences, applying them in the quest for a coherent definition Mesopotamian religious culture(s).    

[The book is very useful to get a general introduction to ancient Mesopotamian religion about many topics. Notwithstanding the briefness of the book, the author is able to condense in few pages many different themes on Mesopotamian religion, providing the reader with basic definitions of specific terms and with a historical discussion on theoretical approach on the topic.]
