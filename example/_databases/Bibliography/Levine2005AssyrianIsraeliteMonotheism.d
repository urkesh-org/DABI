TO  Neo-Assyrian period; Israelite monotheism; socio-political climate; Yahweh; henotheism

In this article, Levine shifts focus from a broader ancient Near Eastern context to a distinct **Neo-Assyrian** consideration with respect to the development of **Israelite monotheism**. Levine argues that the development of Israelite Monotheism was responsive to the socio-political climate during the reign of **Sennacherib** and influenced what he refers to as the **“God-idea”**. Citing **Thorkild Jacobsen’s** notion as the <<**cosmos as a state**>>, Levine suggests that the development of a single deity dominating the cosmos is a projection of the political reality of the Assyrian empire. He argues that **Yahweh** serves as <<the model for configuring the God-Idea>>, the character of Yahweh being specifically derived from the perceived attributes of what a king is expected to uphold in the distinct Neo-Assyrian context. Levine cites the scholarship of **Simo Parpola** who utilizes biblical passages from **Isaiah** comparatively with Assyrian texts to illustrate this supposition, suggesting that the **cult of Assur** had direct bearing on Israelite monotheism. Levine also examines political texts between the **Egyptians**, **Hittites**, and **Assyrians** in order to interpret religious references and <<**divine sanctions**>>. It is suggested that **Sennacherib’s** demotion of **Babylon** with its patron deity **Marduk**, his distinct reverence towards the deity Assur directly influenced the character of the deity of Israelite monotheism. Tracing the political history of the region, Levine argues that early Israelite religion was **henotheistic** during its inception, and developed to express monotheistic qualities in response to the political circumstances of the **Sargonid** dynasty.

TO structure; biblical culture

Buccellati's approach in juxtaposing the **Mesopotamian and Biblical traditions** as possessing inherently structural differences can be contrasted to Levine's assertion that the origin of Biblical tradition is solely a form of response from, and reactionary to, the socio-political configurations of the Assyrian empire. Levine neglects to address philosophical disparities, arguing that ideologies are conceived in reaction to historical events. **Conceptions of the absolute**, for Levine, have no real meaning beyond their relationship to political institutions.
