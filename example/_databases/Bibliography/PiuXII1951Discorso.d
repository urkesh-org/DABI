TO faith; reason

This speech of Pope [Pius XII](http://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en/holy-father/pio-xii.html), addressed to the [Pontifical Academy of Sciences](http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en.html) in 1951, deals with the fundamental topic of the relationship between **faith** and **reason/science**.

In the Pope’s thought, it is clear how reason and science are not considered as enemies of faith (nor quasi “*ancillae theologiae*”), but on the contrary as a useful way to better know the order of the *cosmos*, recognising in it the action of the creator God: <<In fact, true science, contrary to rash assertions of the past, the more it advances, the more it discovers God, as if He were watching and waiting behind every door that science opens>> (Introduction of the speech; English translation by mDP).
