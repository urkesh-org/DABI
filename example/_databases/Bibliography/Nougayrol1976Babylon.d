TO Babylonian religion 

*Chapter 4* of the volume {B}R/Puech1976Storia (by Jean Nougayrol) presents the fundamental concepts of **Babylonian religion**, dealing with the actual perception of religion in historical times, the pantheon, clergy, cults and ceremonies, mythology, prayer, and magic.

At the beginning, the author underlines how it is impossible to analyse Babylonian religious thought without taking into account its origin from Sumerian religion. The author focuses on delineating the basic **similarities** and mostly the evident **differences** between the two religious systems, stressing how Babylonian religion benefited of a specific (both linguistic and theoretic) Semitic apport.

The author describes the Babylonian **pantheon** as a ‘static system’: despite the fact that the list of divine names evolved during times (from the Old to the Neo-Babylonian period), the basic organisation of the pantheon remains almost the same. Furthermore, the author points out the system of ***interpretatio Babyloniaca*** of Sumerian deities, a well-known process of ‘translation’ of the Sumerian gods’ names into Akkadian), involving sometimes not only a mere linguistic translation of the name but also a different conception of the same deity (changing previous features or adding new attributes).

Religious beliefs are expressed in **myths**: the author stresses how Babylonian took Sumerian myths and ‘completed’ some of them, adding new elements previously absent: e.g., the basic account of the creation was taken by the Babylonians from previous Sumerian version (such as the [*Eridu Genesis*](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.7.4#), the [*Barton Cylinder*](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&ObjectID=P222183), the *Debate between Sheep and Grain*, [transliteration](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3.2&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc#)-[translation](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.2#), and the *Debate between Winter and Summer*, [transliteration](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3.3&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc#)-[translation](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.3#)), later ‘completed’ with the composition of the [*Enûma Eliš*](https://www.ancient.eu/article/225/enuma-elish---the-babylonian-epic-of-creation---fu/) and the *Atramhasis* (for a general introduction to this text and an English translation, see {B}R/Foster2005Before, pp. 227-280).   

A concretization of religious beliefs of the Babylonians is testified by **prayers** and **exorcisms**: anyhow, the author underlines how also in this field we cannot have a direct access to personal prayer, since what we do have is represented by composition written by scribes, according to a precise tradition (thus, we deal with a ‘social belief’).

**Mantic** is specific of Babylonian culture: the author stresses how in this sphere the contact with previous Sumerian tradition is almost lacking. The many different mantic techniques of the Babylonians are then carefully displayed. 

Other actualizations of religious beliefs can be found in **magic** and **ceremonies**, stressing again how in Babylon ‘religion’ and ‘magic’ were two spheres strictly connected each other. 

The author points out a noteworthy concept: speaking about Babylonian religion, we have to admit that we are actually dealing with Babylonian religion**s**, since the documentation on this topic is very multifaceted, and we do not have a systematic original expression of Babylonian ‘theoretical religion’.

At the end of the chapter, the author retraces the influences of Babylonian religion on coeval or later religious beliefs and the survival of Babylonian religious elements in other cultures (e.g. Hittites, Israel, Greece, and Rome), reaching also modern times through influences on the Old Testament.  
 

[This chapter delineates the Babylonian religious belief and its concrete manifestations in cultic activities. The remark expressed in § 9 (where the author recognises influences and survivals of Babylonian religion), can support G. Buccellati’s idea expressed in *Chapter 2*, *Section 3*: <<A second reason why the Mesopotamian religion is of deep interest to us today is its **continuity** with our cultural and religious traditions. On the one hand, certain fossils have survived in their specific reality, such as, astrology. But the **influence** on the very structure of our way of thinking is far more significant than these specific details, because it affects the social and intellectual sphere as a whole>>.]

<<A second reason why the Mesopotamian religion is of deep interest to us today is its **continuity** with our cultural and religious traditions. On the one hand, certain fossils have survived in their specific reality, such as, astrology. But the **influence** on the very structure of our way of thinking is far more significant than these specific details, because it affects the social and intellectual sphere as a whole>> (G. Buccellati,  *Chapter 2*, *Section 3*). This idea can be supported by § 9 in {B}R/Nougayrol1976Babylon, where the author recognises influences and survivals of Babylonian religion on coeval and later cultures.
