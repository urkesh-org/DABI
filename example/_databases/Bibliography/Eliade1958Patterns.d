TO comparative religion

<<Professor Eliade states that the aim of the book is to deal "with a twofold problem: first, what is religion and, secondly, how far can one talk of the history of religion?" (p. xii). In regard to the first of these problems, dispensing with any a priori definition of religious phenomena, the author, with great erudition and drawing upon innumerable examples from widely different cultures and varying levels of religious experience, attempts the examination of various "hierophanies", or manifestations of the sacred. Beginning with hierophanies at different cosmic levels, - sky, waters, earth, stones - he goes on to consider biological hierophanies - the rhythm of the moon, the sun, vegetation and agriculture, sexuality - and then to local hierophanies - consecrated places, temples - and finally, in two interesting chapters, he discusses the significance of myths and symbols. As to how far we can talk of the history of religion, Professor Eliade hardly comes to grips with the problem at all, but suggests that this subject will be dealt with later in a companion volume.>> (From a review by D. Howard Smith, 1959)
