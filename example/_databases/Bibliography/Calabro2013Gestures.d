TO gestures

<<Prayer, including praise as well as supplication, tends to be understood as the offering up of words that are enunciated and heard. However, prayer also has an important visual component, especially in the context of the temple, where ritual actions are a focus. The quintessential type of **gesture associated with prayer** in the ancient world was the lifting of the hands, a visual sign that accompanied verbal expressions of praise and entreaty>> (from author’s incipit).

[This online paper offers some insights on the actual praying gestures in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia, underlining how prayer needs to be analysed in all its components, both textual and ritual aspects, with a specific focus of the ‘hand-lifting praying’ attitude.]
