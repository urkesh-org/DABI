A newly discovered inflectional ending *-am* of the construct state, is here documented and discussed in detail. The examples noted (163-167) are 27, divided in four groups: (l) 14 expressions like *damgam &#299;ni* "good of eye(s)," where construct is on adjective of condition; (2) 8 expressions like *aklam i&#353;&#257;ti* "eaten by fire," where construct is a passive adjective; (3a) 3 expressions like *Atram-has&#299;s* "surpassing in understanding," like type 1 but with construct in the absolute state rather than the genitive; (3b) 2 expressions like *apkallam &#353;ipir* "expert in workmanship," where construct is a substantive and the construant in the absolute state. Examples range from OB to LB, attested only in poetry, names and lexical lists; the construct is always in the singular. The examples go back probably to two main types, one with the construent in the genitive, the other in the absolute state. Syntactically, these expression must be taken as "Bahuvrihi" compounds: they are attested in all Semitic languages and occasionally they give rise to morphological pecularities (in Arabic, the use of the article before the construct). In Akkadian (170-71) the pecularity is twofold: (1) the mimation, for which one may refer to loc. *-um* which retains mimation in the construct, and (2) the vowel *a* which is more likely to be an original construct state ending than a frozen accusative ending  (reasons: *a* in early Akk. loanwords in such, *a* is normally  in construct represents *a* < *a*, *a* is the construct ending in Ethiopic.
