Against suggestions to the contrary, Haupt maintains that *e* has phonematic status, on the following grounds: (l) Existence of minimal pairs contrasting *i* and *e*, e.g. *ri-e-mu* "grace" vs. *ri-i-mu* "wild ox". (2) Loanwords from Akkadian into other languages, e.g. *be-e-lu* "lord" as b&#275;l in Hebrew down to *b&#275;lus* in Latin; 13 such loanwords are listed. (3) Comparative considerations: in other Semitic languages *a* changes to *e* under influence of an *i* and as the result of the "quiescing" of a "guttural.‚Äù In the final summary, the rules about Akk. *e* are clearly stated: *a* in conjuction with the quiescing of '3-5 becomes regularly *e*, sometimes also with '1-2; exceptions to the first part of the rule are *al&#299;bu*, *annu*, *agalu*, *adi*, *at&#363;du*, *agrabu* and *&#257;ribu*. The extension of the rule to vowels not in contact with the laryngeal is stated by saying that *a* becomes *e* under the influence of a preceding or following *e*.
