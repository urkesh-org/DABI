The author firstly investigates the epistemological nature of an omen, defined as <<a clearly defined perception understood as a sign pointing to future events whenever it manifests itself under identical circumstances>>. Maul highlights the empirical nature of an omen, since the normative relationship between what is perceived and the future event is established following a period of detailed examination of the world. He also stresses, however, that starting from the second millennium BCE Mesopotamian omina ceased to be detected empirically, and a firm conceptual link was established following the application of regularities. Similarly to Buccellati's frequent search for an '-emic' vocabulary, also Maul looks for a Sumerian or Akkadian equivalent for the terms 'oracle' or 'omen' - coming to the conclusion that there are no such terms in the Mesopotamian vocabulary. The scholar provides a very well written and detailed synthesis of divination in Ancient Mesopotamia, providing examples of their different types, modes, as well as cultural and social background.

Maul highlights how in ancient Mesopotamia ominous signs were indeed interpreted as divine revelations and insights into the intentions of the gods, and yet men could also change the future revealed by the signs through prayers, sacrifices and incantations which could make the gods revise their intentions. Thus, future was conceived as the result of a dialogue between man and god: deities could speak directly to humans (through prophets, dreams, or signs in the sky, on earth, and even on people). On their side, men could take the initiative and seek for divine guidance in a variety of ways (oracles, sacrifices, rituals). Maul, therefore, comes to the conclusion that divination was <<not an expression of fatalism or a listless resignation. Instead, it allowed shape to be given to an amorphous, in many situations threatening, future. This deprives the at first unfathomable future of some of its dread.>> (p. 363)
