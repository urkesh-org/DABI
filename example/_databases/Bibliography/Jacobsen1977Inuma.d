TO dullu (Akkadian)

The article proposes a new interpretation and contextualization of the introductory lines of *Atrahasis*. After having discussed the terms *i-lu* and *a-wi-lum* on the basis of other occurrences within the text itself, Jacobsen investigates the context of the first 6 lines of the poem and takes into consideration, in particular, the meaning of the Akkadian term ***dullum*** in «its specialized sense of corvée, a sense otherwise attested in Old Babylonian only in Elam.» (p. 116). 
In Jacobsen's view, the term *dullum* is made more vivid by the image of the work-basket which parallels it in ll. 2-4: he proposes that ancient authors attributed to *dullum* a meaning that went beyond a purely objective description, but that rather aimed to describe toe psychological effect of the imposed work. «In so doing the poet skillfully develops, as it were, aspects inherent in the objectively descriptive terms he has just used: *dullum* is now given its meaning "misery"» (p. 117)
