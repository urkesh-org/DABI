<<Reports on **dreams** as well as **dream-omina** are common in ancient Egyptian literature. They reflect a tradition beginning in the second millennium BCE, which left its mark on Greek and Arabic literature. The issue of the present research is to find out whether the **Egyptian influence** is also evident in dreams in the Bible, particularly those presented as dreams of the Egyptian officials and of Pharaoh in the **Joseph narrative** (Gen 40-41). A comparison of these dreams with the Egyptian dream pattern shows that they have common features regarding the types of dream, their structure, methods of formulation, and ways of interpretation. There can be no doubt that the narratives of the dreams of the officials and of Pharaoh contain authentic Egyptian elements and features. These are drawn from various areas of life in ancient Egypt: the King’s court, landscape and nature, economy, mythology, religion, and magic. Even Egyptian words transliterated into Hebrew are interspersed in these narratives. Therefore, the biblical text cannot be properly understood without recognition of its Egyptian setting>> (author’s abstract).

[The author analyses the biblical passages of [*Gen.* 40-41](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=40&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls) regarding Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dreams, underlining some possible links to Egyptian dream texts.]
