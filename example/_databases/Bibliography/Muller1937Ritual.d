TO rituals in Assyria; enthronement

Among the many **rituals** performed in ancient Mesopotamia, that of the **enthronement of the new king** (text 1 in this book) was particularly felt by ancient people, specifically during the Neo-Assyrian kingdom, when the king was perceived as the deputy on earth of the most important god of the pantheon, Assur. Besides, the author presents another text reporting instruction for the servants of the king for the preparation of the king’s meal (text 2 in this book): being the king the hypostasis of a god, also his meal has to be prepared with carefulness.  

[These two texts clearly exemplify the connection of the Neo-Assyrian king with the god Assur; on the same topic, cf. also {B}R/Liverani2017Assyria, mostly Chs. 2-3.]
