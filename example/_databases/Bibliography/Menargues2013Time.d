This paper analyzes the topic of ancient perception of time with an original and significative approach, which is profoundly hermeneutical in its taking firstly into consideration the modern sensorial consideration of time so as to <<**avoid potential misconceptions about interpretations of thoughts in ancient times caused by not having considered precisely the subjectivity of our own modern way of thinking**>> (p. 211).

The Mesopotamian notion of time is exemplified by extracts from the literary compositions *Atrahasis* and *Enuma Eliš*, while modern understanding is mainly investigated by using extracts from the *Critique of Pure Reason* by Immanuel Kant - though modern physicists such as Stephen Hawking, Steven Weinberg and Albert Einstein are also discussed. Further examples are taken from Aristotle’s and Martin Heidegger’s writings.

The author is perfectly aware of the difficulty to translate different languages from different linguistic branches, due to the fact that <<all languages mould the manner in which a person thinks and perceives reality. The more distant two languages are, the more complicated the complete transfer of an idea between both languages can be>> (p. 214). And yet, precisely thanks to such awareness he manages to carefully discuss the ancient literary passages, highlighting the similarities and differences between the ancient and modern thoughts and providing useful insights on the ancient Mesopotamian perception of time.
