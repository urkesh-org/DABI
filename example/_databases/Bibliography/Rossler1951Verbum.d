Akkadian verbal system is unique with respect to other Semitic languages in that (l) the prefix conjunction (type *iprus*) is used only for action verbs, (2) the verbs of condition, never occurring in the prefixed forms, occur in the stative. Peculiar to Akkadian together /with Mahri and Ethiopic is the pattern of the type iparras for incomplete action. There are close parallels in Bedauye (Cushite) and especially in Libyan-Berbar, as shown by the following correlations (in function as well as form) between Akkadian and Libyan: *purus* ~ *efras* , *iprus* ~ *ifres*, *iparras* ~ *ifarras*, *&#353;apris* ~ *sefres*, *u&#353;apras* ~ *isafras*. The author concludes that the system presupposed by Akk. and Libyan is closer to Protosemitic than that of the other Semitic languages.
