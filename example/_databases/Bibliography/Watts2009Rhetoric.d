Watt's article is founded on one main assumption: «Ritual rhetoric ... pervaded royal propaganda, as well as temple texts. It also provided the principal rationale for criticizing the *status quo*.» (p. 39). The author follows Aristotle and Kenneth Burke in defining rhetoric in terms of "persuasion", because he believes that such definition allows a modern reader to identify one of the main features of ancient Near Eastern texts - i.e. the intention to mandate and/or prohibit certain behaviors on the part of the readers or hearers. Wyatt also analyzes the category "ritual" - which he defines as «a modern heuristic device for distinguishing and describing certain kinds of human behavior.» (p. 40) providing in particular definitions for "ritual texts" (i.e. «texts that describe or prescribe rituals») and "ritual rhetoric" («a wider range of statements that invoke either ritual behavior itself or the institutions that sponsor ritual behavior (temples, priesthoods, etc.) for persuasive purposes.», p. 40).

Watts attributes to ritual rhetoric a significant role in ancient Mesopotamian society: indeed, he maintains that it provided an ideological basis for political criticism while also serving as a powerful means of persuasion. He sees rhetoric as clearly grounded in the practices of temples and shrines, yet with a far-reaching impact and a power to shape the ideological grounds for political power and resistance. Furthermore, Watts believe that the sudy of ancient ritual rhetoric is able to provide insights into the political and social struggles of the the less documented non-elite people, in their everyday lives.
