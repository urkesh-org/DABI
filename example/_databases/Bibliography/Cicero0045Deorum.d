TO relationship; religion; agnosticism; ideology and religion

This dialog, about two-thirds conserved, develops a deep, and in a certain sense heartfelt, critique of polytheism. Three different positions are expressed, of which two are ideological (epicurean and stoic), while the third properly treats the *relationship* with the gods, and thus with religion as practice: this last is substantially agnostic. The author does not take a clear position, but leans toward the stoic ideology.

Of particular interest is the third part, which refers the point of view of Aurelio Cotta, formally the most engaged in the practice of religion (as supreme priest), yet declares himself agnostic, to the point that he approvingly refers the use of the term "atheist" (the term explicitly appears in III 89). Cotta develops the argument according to which the intrinsic validity of the cult resides in the fact that it is a purely external form, socially valuable, but lacking any spiritual depth. This exposition seems to be coherent with the majority of sentiments in a polytheistic world, a substantially skeptical sentiment that indicates a deep crisis.

[The divorce between ideology and religion illustrates very well one of the main conclusions of my work, which is that spirituality (as an authentic form of ideology) must remain alive if one wants religion to maintain its vital reality. It also illustrates how religion can become an instrument of social control, which excludes the possibility for spirituality to have an influence on public life--which is a very present question in the contemporary world. Note how the first two interlocutors do not actually speak of religion, while the third (Cotta) speaks of the gods only in function of the formal practices of the cult.]

TO experience; religious practice; bigotry

Original authentic experience tends to be codified and crystallized in time. The resulting "bigotry" must be distinguished from the original experience, whether one is observing this spiritual dynamic in Mesopotamia or in Biblical religion. Furthermore, a value in purely external religious rites can be discerned. See: ({B}R/Cicero0045Deorum).
