TO divination; prophecy

The starting point of this paper is the analysis of two Akkadian texts (the Uruk Prophecy and the Dynastic Prophecy) which employ a phraseology that may be compared with the Biblical book of Daniel. In the opening paragraphs, while considering the possible similarity between Mesopotamian forms of communication with the gods and biblical prophecy Scurlock offers a synthesis of the comparative studies, stating: <<That a repositioning into their original Mesopotamian context might require a re-evaluation of theologically significant biblical texts is a reason to embrace, not to avoid, comparison.>> (p. 277) However, rather than making a distinction between a message from God directly delivered from a living person and something which makes predictions in the form of a written composition (as it was often the case in Mesopotamia), Scurlock suggests to create sub-categories within the designation "prophecy", to reflect the potentially significant differences between oral and written forms of the phenomenon (p. 277, fn. 2).

With regards to the specific case of Mesopotamian "prophecies" which actually refer to events that have, in fact, already occurred, Scurlock goes against the idea of regarding them as false prophecy or political propaganda and suggests a new approach which inverts the paradigm and asks not whether Mesopotamian divination can represent a form of prophecy, but whether biblical prophecy can represent a form of divination. The question, then, would be whether prophecy involves not only the present and the future but also the past.

Scurlock identifies similarities in Mesopotamian and biblical prophecies in their using past historical events affecting the community to divine the will of God; in the existence of procedures that could be used to avert divine wrath and the evil consequences that would follow; and in the presence of solicited and unsolicited omens (so much so that historical events could be seen as part of a code whereby Yahweh communicated with his people and could, therefore, be used to decode and validate other messages delivered by other means, as by direct vision).

Ultimately, then, the scholar maintains that the Uruk Prophecy and the Dynastic Prophecy might be qualified as prophetic texts in the biblical sense. However, she also identifies a significant difference in the fact that the Bible has a inherently universal quality, whereas the Mesopotamian textss are typically geograhically and culturally focused on a particular city-state (Uruk or Babylon in the two case-studies considered here).
