<<Divination was one facet of that complex in Mesopotamia’s early historical periods. This elaborate system of knowledge claimed the ability to read and interpret the signs putatively encoded by the gods in the fabric of the phenomenal world: the entrails of a sheep, earthquakes, happenings in the sky, facets of the urban landscape and city life, the days in the calendar, medical symptoms, the appearance of the human body as well as birth defects, human sexual habits, dreams, and myriad other domains of experience […]. In the present article I will look at one type of divination in particular, **extispicy**, the practice of reading and interpreting the entrails of a sacriﬁcial animal, known already from the Bible and identiﬁed early on in cuneiform tablets in the 1870s >> (from p. 98).

[This paper deeply investigates ancient Mesopotamian extispicy, starting from the Old Babylonian period onwards, displaying the main sources, reconstructing the archaeological contexts of the **liver clay models**, and attempting at retrieving the religious background of such a divinatory practice.]
