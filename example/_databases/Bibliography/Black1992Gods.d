TO Mesopotamian gods; Mesopotamian demons; Mesopotamian symbols

This volume offers an illustrated presentation of many ancient Mesopotamian divine entities (both gods and demons) along with symbols related to them. 

The book is structured in alphabetical order and displays many useful illustrations (by Tessa Rickards) of the described entities, taken from different iconographical sources, such as reliefs, seals, and archaeological artefacts.    

In the *Introduction*, the authors set the chronological and geographical framework of their work, describing the many different people inhabiting the ancient Mesopotamian area.
 
[This book represents a compact but complete handbook for the description of many supernatural entities in Mesopotamia.]
