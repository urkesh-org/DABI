This work examines Middle Babylonian phonetic writing as found among the varied dialects existing in northern Assyria and Western Mesopotamia during the l6th to 11th centuries BC. The author determines first the provenience of the texts under study, and then proceeds to analyze variations in writing vowels and consonants with in this corpus of texts. In conclusion, the author has managed to locate dialectical variation by geographic locale and he lists the particular phonetic features which are common to each specific group. In addition, his findings have allowed him to postulate two important principles of phonetic interaction taking place in the evolution of Accadian dialects.
