This article outlines the approach by the French school of **historiography** known as *Annales*. The presentation of history as a scientific report of facts would not reach its potential until the 18th century under the scholarship of **Leopold von Ranke** in Germany. In France, the periodical **Annales: Economies, Sociétés, Civilizations**, was originated by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch during an era of **Marxist** scholarship. The *Annales* school of thought encorporated an interdisciplinary trinity of **Serialism**, **Structuralism** and **Functionalism** to the study of history, championing the concept of history as the **synthesis** of economics, society and culture - birthing the ***longue durée***. Serialism represents the aim of achieving the “greatest possible measure of scientific rigor”, most evident in the study of demographics as an objective form of census. Structuralism requires building models of “social structures” and the examination of variables as they relate to each other and the whole. Functionalism seeks to understand the **interaction** between the concept of “total history” as it can be deduced from the study of economies, societies and civilizations. Braudel’s *pensée globale* sought to encompass the totality of a civilization for the purpose of “weighing” it for cultural comparison. Criticisms of the Annales school included the deliberate avoidance of politics and issues of the state.
