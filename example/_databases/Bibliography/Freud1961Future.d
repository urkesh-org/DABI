TO origin and future of religion

In this contribution, Freud tries to explain (on the base of a psychoanalytical approach) the **origin and the modern decline of religious thought**. To sum up in few words, religious thought originated from the incapability of human beings (mostly during their childhood) to explain natural phaenomena. Hence the origin (the ‘creation’ or ‘invention’) of gods and religion. Due to the modern, increasing development of scientific speculation, this ancestral need for a religious explanation of ununderstood natural phaenomena is no more active (or needed at all).

[A very good epitome (by Brad Lancaster) of the entire Freud’s contribution can be found [here](https://www.lancasterlawoffice.com/wp-content/uploads/Freud-Future-of-an-Illusion6.pdf).]

[In his volume G. Buccellati deals with the topic of ‘psychological attitudes’ on religion; this paper by Freud helps in better understanding how psychoanalysis describes and interprets the origin of and the need for a religious explanation of natural phenomena.]
