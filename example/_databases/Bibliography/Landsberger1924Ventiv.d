The ending *-m* serves as directional marker ("Richtungsexponent") and
more precisely direction toward (the speaker, the addresse or a third
party). The ventive is found therefore especially with verbs of movement and, by attraction, with other verbs which are conjoined by means
of *-ma* to ventives. When the pronominal suffix of 1st person in the
accusative is attached to the ventive, the ventive may have simply an
old locative meaning ("here") instead of directional or terminative
("toward"). In poetry the ventive is also used for metric reasons
without a precise directional meaning. — The basic marker is *-m*, with
*-a-* added before it to resolve a consonantal cluster when necessary
(as with the feminine marker *-t* which may be preceded by *a*). The *ni*
of the plural is a connective element which may reflect an earlier, more
specialized mood, or a "strenghtening" of the plural (as with the
plural of the noun in *-&#257;n*). — The *-m* of the pronominal suffixes in
the dative is the same as the modal marker of the ventive. Addition
of dative pronominal suffixes to the ventive is possible and varies
depending on the dialects.— A directional mood is missing in other
Semitic languages, but is found in Sumerian.
