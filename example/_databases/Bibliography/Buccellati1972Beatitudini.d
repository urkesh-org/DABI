The author presents in this paper a comparison between the two pericopes related to the **Beatitudes** (as recounted in the Gospels of Matthew [*Mt.* 5, 3-12](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PVE.HTM) and Luke [*Lk.* 6, 20-26](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWP.HTM)) and texts from the ancient Near East and Egypt.

After having recalled that the ‘genre’ of the beatitudes can be found also in the Old Testament, both in the ‘non-paradoxical’ and ‘paradoxical’ forms (the latter only in few instances, such as [*Job* 5, 17](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PEQ.HTM)), the author moves to retrace some ‘beatitudes-schemes’ also in Mesopotamian and Egyptian texts, underlying some previous studies which recognized a kind of ‘beatitude-scheme’ also in the Aristotelian concept of **περιπέτεια (*peripéteia*)** (see p. [243](http://giorgiobuccellati.net/EL2/Buccellati_1972_Le_Beatitudini_sullo_sfondo_-_BeO_14.pdf#page=3), notes 7-11 for bibliographical references). 

After this statement, the author moves to analyse some Mesopotamian texts which could represent an antecedent to the evangelical Beatitudes: despite the difficulty in identify a specific *form* of Beatitudes, it is possible to envisage in Mesopotamian literature some texts presenting the same perspective of a regular changing of the lots in the life of specific human beings.

The first ‘genre’ of texts analysed by the author is that of the so-called **prophecies** or **apocalypses** of the Akkadian tradition. Another category of texts comparable to the Beatitudes is that of the ***omina*** presenting sentences in hypothetical form (“if A happens, thus B will happen”. The result of this comparison is stressed on p. 248: <<The comparison between the Mesopotamian canon and the Beatitudes therefore has value not on the level of the collection as a single literary whole, that is, not on the level of literary forms and genres, rather on the level of the content proper to the individual clauses, isolated from their context>> (English translation by mDP).

The author then presents (pp. 249-261) a synoptic view of the evangelic beatitudes with the texts of the aforementioned *omina* (also including in the analysis some Akkadian personal names), outlining several comparison dealing with eight specific topics: 1) poverty and humility, strength and weakness, ignorance; 2) weeping and suffering; 3) hunger and thirst; 4) justice (and binary opposition ‘light vs. darkness’); 5) mildness; 6) mercy; 7) purity of heart; 8) peace.

Here are the general conclusions: <<(1) The form of the Beatitudes dates back to the Old Testament and is also found in ancient Egypt [for Mesopotamia see the observation above on p. [255](http://giorgiobuccellati.net/EL2/Buccellati_1972_Le_Beatitudini_sullo_sfondo_-_BeO_14#page=255.pdf)]; this form, and its use in a non-paradoxical sense is therefore parenetic, probably refers to a cultic *Sitz im Leben*. (2) The paradoxical aspect of the Beatitudes (or at least most of them) can be explained basing on an influence by the wisdom tradition. Paradoxical indications are found in various points of this tradition; one of the most suitable documents for comparison is the Canon, which not only includes the same themes present in the Beatitudes, but also presents them in a codifying and programmatic form. The new elements of the Beatitudes are the messianic and eschatological ones>> (pp. 263-264).
