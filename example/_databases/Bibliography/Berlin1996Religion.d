TO politics and religion

This volume explores little known aspects of **religion** as it intersects with **politics** in ancient Mesopotamia, biblical Israel, the Qumran community, and Roman Palestine, from the second millennium BC to the early centuries AD. Topics include the Bible as a political document, the cultic calendar of Ur, Mesopotamian witchcraft in an increasingly urbanized society, and the Christianizing of cities in the Roman Empire.
