The basic conjunctive device, between sentences as well as between nouns is asyndeton; the particle *u* means "and also," and the enclitic *-ma*, even in a conjunctive function, is the same as the emphatic particle: it stresses the first sentence which gives the basic grounds from which the second sentence is derived as a consequence. Therefore *-ma* is to be translated as "and then," "and as a result," and only in later periods it comes to have a simple conjunctive value "and."
