This chapter in *The Oxford Handbook of Rituals* deeply investigates some topics related to the sphere of **death and afterlife** and in the Bible and the Ancient Near East.

[Specifically interesting to the discussion of afterlife in the Bible is the section devoted to a re-analysis of the passage in [1 Sam 28](https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=28&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls) and the interpretation of the Hebrew *&#244;´b*.]
