An insightful article, which, taking as a starting point a text of
Nar&#257;m-S&#299;n, deals with embedding of clauses ("encasing" or "boxing"
with the German term) and with the use of coordination in place of
subordination. This type of coordination is common expecially to
express temporal relationships, less so in an antithetic-concessive
sense; unlike the casÂ£ in Indo-european languages, in Semitic even
coordination for subordination may be embedded, e.g.-. "When the countries revolted against me, then *my father had bestowed benefits on
Kish*, and Kish revolted against me," where italics indicate an embedded coordinate sith a concessive value ("even though my father...").
Coordination of this type is also used where English prefers an adverbial phrase, e.g. "Kish gathered and..." for "Kish, in a revolutionary gathering..." i.e. Akkadian (and Semitic in general) prefers a
more concrete type of expression. The "clause character of a co-ordinated complex" not marked by any segmental features, may have been
marked in speech by intonation. A complex hierarchy of embedded coordinate clauses is possible, which the author symbolises graphically by
a linear sequence of letters [similar in nature to the "tree" of generative grammars].
