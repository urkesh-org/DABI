This article investigates the relationship between men and gods in first millennium BCE Assyria within the specific realm of cultic commensality, which is considered to be a particularly significant and expressive moment of such relationship. In this perspective, ceremonial banquets were the physical tool through which direct contact with the supernal world was possible.

At first, daily meals consumed in Assyrian temples are described, with their main phases and specific human agents who performed well-defined task in well-defined moments. Once the food had been set on the tables placed in front of the divine statues, it assumed a special nature: its consumption normally took place in the innermost areas of temples, at the presence of only the gods themselves. Cases in which a few privileged men (usually the king alone) could share the same food and drinks with the deities were indeed extremely rare. However, even in these cases it was not a true act of sharing food: men ate their meal in the courtyard of the shrines, along with the gods - who simultaneously consumed their food a few meters away, in the privacy of their private apartments.

At pp. 322-326, one specific issue is addressed: "How did gods eat?". There is no Neo-Assyrian source - nor any written text from any other period of the entire Mesopotamian history - that provides an answer about how gods could effectively eat their meals. This question was raised also in ancient times, as the account of the "Bel and the Dragon" (in the 14th chapter of the Biblical book of Daniel) testifies. Gods partook of meals through the physical presence of their icons and statues, which underwent two specific rituals designated as "mouth-washing" and "mouth-opening".

It is stated that the focus of the entire sacred meals in ancient Near Eastern cultures was actually on the favourable receiving of the offerings presented to the gods by their devotees: indeed, there was no need to hide the fact that the food did not actually "disappear" into the stomachs of the deities. The very fact that food was accepted triggered a series of causes and effects which, ultimately, had tangible and positive outcomes for those who performed the rituals.
