TO prophecy

<<Recent work on the **prophetic phenomenon** in the ancient Near East has mainly focused on the Paleo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian eras as well as, naturally, on the biblical corpus, often with a comparative perspective between these different areas. The second half of the 2nd millennium BC received relatively little attention, as mentions of prophets are rare and scattered there. In fact, in texts from this period, from four different sites, we find mentions of people who are or could be prophets. None of their attestations clearly show them in the exercise of their inspired activities; but these individuals are designated by various terms: āpilu, maḫḫû, and nābû, all already known at the time of Amorite with the sure or probable meaning of “prophet”. The following study gathers the references of the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, then compares them to the Paleo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian texts, to see if a translation by “prophet” is at least possible>> (from p. 21; English translation from French by mDP).

[This paper tries to cross the boundaries between Israelite sources, basically the Old Testament, and the ancient Near Eastern document about the phaenomenon of prophetism, in search of specific Akkadian terms referring to prophets and prophetesses in second-millennium Mesopotamia.]
