TO Sumerian liturgies; Psalms

The author presents in this volume a comparison between **Sumerian liturgies** and **Psalms**, stressing structural and functional differences and similarities between these two compositions.

[The comparison established by the author clarifies how to approach the analysis of texts of different cultures but pertaining to a similar ‘genre’ or, at least, structural similarities between textual compositions within the same context, in this case, religious texts written to be read or actions to be performed on religious occasions.]
