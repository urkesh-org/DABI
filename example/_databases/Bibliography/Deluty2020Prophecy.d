The stated goal of this article is to provide an introduction to the historical phenomenon of prophecy in the Ancient Levant and Old Babylonian Mari. It focuses on several topics, such as the terminology for prophetic personnel, prophecy as a system of communication, the link between prophecy and monarchy at Mari, and the question of biblical prophetic books and their relationship to prophetic practice. 

The approach is comparative, similar to the one used by Buccellati in his volume, and the author surveys several ancient sources from both the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East (with a particular focus on the Old Babylonian archives of the 18th century BCE kingdom of Mari). Overall, Biblical and Mesopotamian sources are very well delineated and contextualized (ยง2). Additionally, Hebrew and Akkadian terminology are analysed in detail (ยง3). Also, the article offers throughtout a rich and updated bibliography on the topic of prophecy in the Bible and in Mari. 

Deluty provides a useful analysis of two topics which are relevant also for Buccellati's discussion on prophetism: firstly, she discusses whether ancient prophecy could be considered as a sub-type of divination and, if so, if it should indeed be labeled as "noninductive" or "intuitive" divination - extispicy being, instead, a sort of technical divination. Then, the author highlights an aspect which has often been underestimated by modern scholars: namely, the human intermediary who often stands between the prophet and the final recipient of the message. In investigating this issue, Deluty aims to offer a new perspective in the history of prophecy in the Ancient Levant and Old Babylonian Mari - revealing the human networks at play in the delivery of a divine message, a process which the author considers to be inextricably related to the practice of prophecy and to the central role of the prophet within ancient monarchies.
