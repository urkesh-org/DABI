Glassner opens his text with a clear statement: there is an indissoluble bond between the Power and the Sacred: the sacred is part of the very structure of power («Il existe entre le Pouvoir et le Sacré un lien indissoluble: le sacré fait partie de la structure même du pouvoir.», p.9).

In this paper, the scholar reviews the many theories proposed in Assyriology on the topic of "king-priest", from Deimel (1920) onward - with many bibliographical references. Then, he offers his own assessment based on philological, iconographical and historical evidence. Ultimately, Glassner states that - though the religious character of the royalty in Mesopotamian cannot be doubted, we do not see that the Mesopotamian kings ever exercised, in the first half of the third millennium BCE, the functions of priests. There is, moreover, no evidence of a Mesopotamian society where the king-priest had the exclusivity of any ritual. However, Glassner identifies an exception in the figure of the king Lugalzage.si - particularly on the basis of an inscription in which he presented himself as the king of Uruk and priest of the goddess Nisaba. Indeed, this may be explained by the fact that Lugalzagesi was the son of a priest - a function which the son probably took up as an inheritance: that a high-ranking priest could rise to royal dignity is not strange in Mesopotamia: two similar cases are known, those of Il (sanga of Zabalam who became king of Umma) and of En.entar.zi (sanga of the god Ningirsu who became king of Lagash).
