Arabic *(a)ta*, Hebrew and Syriac *(a)t* have both an adverbial function. The basic underlying form *-ta* is connected with the pronoinal element *tu*, *ti*. The same pronomianl element occurs also in "Assyrian" where hoever the side form *&#353;u*, *&#353;i* are also attested. "Assyrian" *i&#353;* (more seldom *a&#353;*) is to be connected with the pronominal elements *&#353;u*, *&#353;i*, and therefore ultimately with the adverbial ending *ta* of West Semitic, with which it shares a common adverbial function. Note also the extended forms *-&#257;ni&#353;* (e.g. *ab&#363;b-&#257;ni&#353;*) in "Assyrian," and *-anni&#353;* (e.g., *qador-anni&#353;*) in Hebrew.
