TO Akkadian “hand-lifting” prayers

This volume aims to be a specific investigation on a peculiar kind of Akkadian prayers called *šuillas*, i.e., **“hand-lifting”** prayers. 

The author specifically focuses on the analysis of the rubrics of these texts, discussing the many terms used in Akkadian to express the concept of ‘prayer’, trying to distinguish actual differences in praying attitudes of ancient Akkadian people. 

The analysis is enriched by and benefits of many images illustrating the physical gesture and attitude of the beseechers as depicted or carved on seals, monumental reliefs, stelae, obelisks, or other monuments, linking textual attestations to iconography. 

[This book is an in-depth discussion and analysis of Akkadian “hand-lifting” prayers; cf. {B}Mes-rel/Ebeling1953Gebetsserie.]
