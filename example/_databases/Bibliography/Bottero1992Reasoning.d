TO Mesopotamian reasoning

<<Our ancestors, the Mesopotamians, invented writing and with it a new way of looking at the world. In this collection of essays, the French scholar Jean Bottéro attempts to go back to the moment which marks the very beginning of history. To give the reader some sense of how Mesopotamian civilization has been mediated and interpreted in its transmission through time, Bottéro begins with an account of Assyriology, the discipline devoted to the ancient culture. This transmission, compounded with countless discoveries, would not have been possible without the surprising decipherment of the cuneiform writing system. Bottéro also focuses on divination in the ancient world, contending that certain modes of worship in Mesopotamia, in their application of causality and proof, prefigure the “scientific mind”.>> (from [editor’s webpage](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3684684.html)).

[The author explains in this volume how a ‘scientific mind’, i.e., a mindset able to reflect and reason on the complexity of reality, did exist already in ancient Mesopotamia, before the advent of Greek philosophy. Bottéro exemplifies this assumption by analysing concrete phaenomena as they are mirrored in specific literary texts, such as divinatory documents, law codes, and wisdom text. In the end of such an analysis, it results that ancient Mesopotamians had a profound and complex capability of investigating and understanding many aspects of reality, showing a logical mind (although sometimes shadowed by religious thought) which can be considered as an antecedent of later Greek logic. On this topic, cf. also {B}R/Frankfort1949Before.]
