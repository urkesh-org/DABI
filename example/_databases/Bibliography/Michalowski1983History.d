TO history; Sumerian King List

This paper approaches the topic of Mesopotamian chronology and endogenous conception of **history** as it can be deduced from the extant text called [**Sumerian King List**](https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm) (cf. on this topic {B}R/Michalowski2012King). 

[The author stresses the importance of interpreting this text, and many others of the same period, within the mythological and religious perspective of the ancient Mesopotamians: Sumerian history (as well as the later accounts of Manetho and Berossus), differently from our modern perspective, included also events connected to mythology and theogony, aspects considered as real and ‘historical’ as many other human facts, such as kings’ deeds, dedication of temples, or military campaign.]
