TO chronology; “Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa”

<<We outline the priority of high quality data of astronomical content as our strategy for the analysis of the ancient **astronomical records** in the search of the absolute chronology of the Near East in II millennium BC. The correspondingly defined set of data for two lunar eclipses of EAE 20 and 21 tablets linked to Ur III period enables us the choice of eclipses of 27 June 1954 BC and 17 March 1912 BC; here the information on the exit position of the darkening of the lunar disk acts as a crucial informator survived in the records. We then discuss why the 56/64 year **Venus cycle** cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. The month length method is discussed as well. In sum the available data support the Ultra-Low Chronology proposed in the book by H. Gasche, J.A. Armstrong, S.W. Cole and V.G. Gurzadyan, “Dating the Fall of Babylon” (1998) and, particularly, leave no astronomical background for the High Chronology. Ultra-Low Chronology is supported also by archaeological, dendrochronological, Assyrian king lists and other data as summarized at the Intern. Colloquium on Ancient Near Eastern Chronology>> (author’s abstract on [Cornell University website](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311035)).

[This paper reviews the topic of the definition of an absolute chronology for Mesopotamian history, mostly basing on the **“Venus Tablet of [Ammisaduqa](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#588)”**, a topic discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume; cfr. also {B}R/Gurzadyan2000Chronology; {B}R/Gurzadyan2003Venus; {B}R/Gurzadyan2005Chronology.]
