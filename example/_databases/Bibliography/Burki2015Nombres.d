TO purity laws

Numbers 5 and 6 constitute an insertion of legal material into the account of the preparations for the march through the wilderness. Scholars have long since noted that the laws are united by their concern to prevent and eliminate sources of impurity. Many semantic and thematic links suggest that this section is a well structured composition, with the three main laws corresponding to the three **purity laws** mentioned at the beginning of the section (5.1-4). This article proposes to take this structure seriously, reading the law on restitution for wrongs (5.5-10) as a specification of the purity law concerning scale diseases, the suspected adulteress or *sotah* (5.11-26) as an amendment to the discharge regulation, and the law on the *nazir* (6.1-21) as a particular case of contact with a corpse. These connections shed light on the particular logic of these laws and point to the social function of purity laws, with each law defining the boundary separating each different group.

Buccellati's reading in section 8.2 contrasts with Bürki's more nuanced treatment of Biblical law. See {B}R/Burki2015Nombres.
