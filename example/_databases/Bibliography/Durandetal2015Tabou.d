TO taboo; sin

The volume collects twenty-one papers which were presented at the Interdisciplinary Colloquium organized by the “Chaire Milieux Bibliques” at the Collège de France in Paris, in 2012. The aim of the conference was to investigate the intrinsic need of every human society of disciplining itself by means of various taboos. Such discipline entails several possible transgressions, which inevitably lead to sanctions: all these aspects are discussed in the volume.

The approach used in the volume is interdisciplinary and comparatist: four main topics are discussed by the authors - 1. linguistic issues and terms used to express the concept of “interdiction”; 2. the economic and social context in which different
ideas of taboos arose, or sanctions were conceived; 3. contact taboos, including sexual regulations; 4. food taboos and table matters.

Overall, this book offers several causes for reflection. The most evident one is **the clear absence of a specific term or phrase used by members of ancient societies to express the equivalent of the modern word “taboo”**. Durand’s analysis of the Mesopotamian corpus, Démare-Lafont’s new interpretation of the expression “to eat a taboo” in a legal text dating to the Third Dinasty of Ur, as well as Erbele-Küster’s analysis of the term *niddâ* as it appears in the Leviticus: these three papers prove that “taboo” and “transgression” were flexible and dynamic categories. This holds true particularly for the Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures, while in Israel interdictions have been more clearly defined through the words written in the Bible.
