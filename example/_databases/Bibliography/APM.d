TO Akkadian Prayer

"The Akkadian Prayer Miscellany is a place for me to post work I've done on a selection of Akkadian prayers. As the name suggests, the project contains a mixture of **different kinds of prayers** from different places and times. The one unifying element is that all of the texts are in Akkadian. As working on this site is not my top research priority, additions will accumulate rather slowly" (after Website's description).
