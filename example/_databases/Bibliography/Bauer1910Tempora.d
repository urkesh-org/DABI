A neo-grammatical approach, with two main conclusions: (1) the original verbal form is the "imperfect" (yaqtul), simply meaning "action"; the reasons are the similarity with the imperative, and the great differentiation in the vocalism; (2) the "perfect" (qatala) is secondary, and derives from a combonation of the nomen agentis and a personal pronoun. In the section on Akkadian (pp. 10-23) the point is made (following Barth and Brockelmann) that qatala is to be found in Akkadian not as ka&#353;ad [the stative], but rather as ikas=&#353;&#353;ad [the present, without duplication of the middle radical].
