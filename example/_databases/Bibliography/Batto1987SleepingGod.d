TO sleeping God; ANE Motifs; divine sovereignty; psalms; Yahweh; Chaoskampf; New Testament; Jesus Christ

This article explores the theme of the <<sleeping God>> as it appears in different Ancient Near Eastern Motifs. Batto contrasts the themes of God(s) sleeping, arising, and exacting divine reign during the night, to instances in <<Psalms>>, <<Canaanite>> and <<Mesopotamian>> traditions. Batto illustrates his stance clearly, suggesting that the biblical motif directly reflects a more ancient Near Eastern origin. He suggests that two principals properly characterize the sleeping god motif: A) "rest as a divine preogrative" and B) "sleeping as a symbol of divine rule". Batto cites instances from Mesopotamian/Ancient Near Eastern stories wherein <<cries>> awaken sleeping gods, intimating that this trope may reflect periods of hardship (famine, drought, etc.). Despite mentioning texts and traditions from an array of cultures within the Near East, Batto's focus remains with the <<Enuma Elish>> and the <<Chaoskampf>> motif. Building on this, he contrasts these tropes with those in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, making direct correlations to Chaoskampf motifs that he believes are utilized to convey the need for God's intervention, his divine authority, and his effectiveness - permeated by rest.

TO psalms; prayer; Yahweh; functions of religious practice; psalmists; sleeping deity

Batto views psalmists in a different light, suggesting that their function is to express the <<eminence of Yahweh>>, despite the existence of evil and suffering. <<Psalmists>> are described as "faithful servants" who seek vindication by Yahweh's <<divine justice>>. In contrast to Buccellati's notion that the psalms express a rich spirituality and consciousness, Batto views psalms as deliberate appropriations from more ancient Near Eastern motifs that function to express the eminence of the <<sleeping deity>>.

TO theodicy; sleeping god motif; evil; suffering; divine justice

Batto presents a unique argument with respect to <<theodicy>>; he suggests that the expression of theodicy as it occurs in Mesopotamian texts is multi-dimensional in that it does not only serve to address the notion of evil in light of god's existence but that it also reflects the motif of the sleeping deity. Theodicy, then, occurs during these moments of <<divine rest>>, and is insufficient to awaken the sleeping god. Buccellati describes the poet of the <<Babylonian Theodicy>> as one who "seeks an answer to the problem in the most honest and painful way...arriving to reject the notion of having to depend on the gods and to offer them no worship". Conversely, theodicy is treated as a symptom of sleep, and Batto argues that the call for Yahweh to <<"wake up">> in Psalms is reflective of an unchanging faith despite the existence of "gross injustice".
