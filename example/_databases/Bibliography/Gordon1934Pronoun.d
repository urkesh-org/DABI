A listing of forms of personal pronouns (indep., suffixes, *ram&#257;nu*),
demonstrative, determinative, relative, indefinite, distributive,
and number (e.g. *gabbu* "all") pronouns. A common characteristic trait
is the displacement of feminine by masculine forms, or, more broadly,
that there is "a general absence of fixed grammatical forms."
