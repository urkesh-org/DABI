After emphasizing the methodological difficulties in the dialectal classification of Semitic languages, 
and after given reasons for considering South-Arabic as a linguistic unity (the unity of Akk. is 
assumed), the author considers the main points which have been made in favor of considering the two 
languages as a common dialectal group: the pronominal suffix of the third person in &#353;, the free combination 
of derived verbal stems, the prefix &#353; of the causative, the imperfect or Akk. present of the type 
iparras, plus some lexical items. The conclusion is that the similarities are more likely the result of archaisms
dating to the time before the separation and preserved independently, rather than common innovations after 
the separation. Hence Akk. and South-Arabic should not be considered as constituting a dialectal group.
