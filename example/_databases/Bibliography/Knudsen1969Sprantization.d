Each of the two velar stops / *g* *k* / may be
realized as fricative / *h* /, normally transcribed
as / *h* /, and alternately a fricative may be
realized as stop according to one of two laws:
(1) Dissimilation of velars: if the word base
contains two identical non-emphatic velar
consonants, one of them may occur either as
stop or as fricative, e. g. *hu&#353;ahhum* = *ku&#353;ahhum*
"famine" (*h*) *k*: 2 examples, *k* ) *h* : 1, *g* ) *h*: l).
(2) Assimilation to vowel: velar after vowel 
may occur either as stop or as fricative, even
with intervening word bounday, e. g. *ahum* ) *akum* 
"brother,"*&#353;ak&#257;nu* ) *&#353;ah&#257;nu* "to place" (*h* ) *k*:
14 examples, *h* > *g* : l, *k* / *h*: 10, *g* ) *h*: l).
Note that the alternation *k* ~ *h* ~ *k* is by far
the most frequent with a total of 27 out of
31 word examples. Spirantization does not
occur with long consonants. The phenomenon is
one of free variation, and is attested accidentally
through occasional misspellings, since it had
not been accepted in normal orthography.
Attestation is especially frequent in OB and SB.
