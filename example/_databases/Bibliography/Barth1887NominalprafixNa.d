The view that patterns with prefix *na-* belong with the passive (niphal) conjugation is refuted on the basis that many roots with such patterns are intransitive. In fact, they have the same functions as patterns with the prefix *ma-*, *na-*, merely like the expression of relationship of place, time, and instrument. The explanation is that *na-* is dissimilated from *ma-* when the first or second syllabus after *ma-* contains a labial: this rule is peculiar to Akkadian, and similar forms in Syriac, Hebrew and Arabic are rare and possibly loanwords.
