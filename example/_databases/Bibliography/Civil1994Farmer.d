TO Farmer’s Instructions

<<**“Farmer’s Instructions** […] is the title given here to a brief, simple didactic text that gives advice on cereal cultivation. […] The title adopted here is based on the one given by the text itself ([na-de<sub>5</sub>-ga](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0034724) “instruction,” “advice,” line 108)>> (from author’s Introduction on p. 1)

[This text, sometimes considered as the Mesopotamian *Georgica*, is relevant to the topic of Mesopotamian wisdom literature, since it reports many (sapiential) instructions to be given to farmers in order to perform their job. It is a clear manifestation of how sapiential clues can be found also in compositions which could, at a first glimpse, not to be inherent to this topic.]
