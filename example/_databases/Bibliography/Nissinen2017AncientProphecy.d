Nissinen's treatment of ancient prophecy aims to discuss individual features of, and examine potential relationships among, three major extant textual groups of sources attesting the prophetical phenomenon in antiquity, i.e., Greek, Ancient Near Eastern, and Biblical. The book's first part deals with issues pertaining to the nature, constitution, and definitions of ancient prophecy. 

The book is divided into three parts. In Part I, "Theory", Nissinen outlines the main theoretical and methodological aspects of his approach. He builds on the fundamental observation that prophecy does not exist as a natural phenomenon; rather, it is constructed, socially and historically - both by the communities in which prophets functioned and by those who seek to define, reconstruct and understand it. Nissinen maintains that ancient human societies sought elaborated their symbolic universe through divination, in an attempt <<to cope with contingency, uncertainty, and insecurity>> (p. 19). In Part II, "Sources", the author employs his methods to the available sources for ancient Near Eastern sources (pp. 57-115), Greek sources (pp. 116-43), and Hebrew Bible (pp. 144-67). Finally, in Part III, "Comparative Essays", Nissinen draws together conclusions from the three corpora previously analyzed, in five thematic essays: "Prophecy and Ecstasy", "Prophets and Temples", "Prophets and Kings" and "Prophecy and Gender".

Some of Nissinen's conclusions are as follows. Considered as an intuitive type of divination, prophecy is sharply distinguished from technical types in Mesopotamian sources, a little less so in the Hebrew Bible, and in a "far from absolute" fashion in Greece (p. 334). The author highlights the affiliation of prophets with temples in all the available sources, while also showing very clearly the political function of prophecy throughout the ancient Eastern Mediterranean. He also reflects on the materiality of prophetical texts, which increasingly became the object of focus <<as a sign and a carrier of revelation>> which led the scribes to relegate oral prophetic performances to a marginal position (p. 352).

Overall, this dense and articulated book draws from a massive amount of primary data and provide extensive and recent bibliography in the field of comparative studies on ancient prophecy.
