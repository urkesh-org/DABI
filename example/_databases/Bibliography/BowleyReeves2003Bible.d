This paper (derived from a previous publication; see at this [link](http://www.sbl-site.org/Newsletter/12_2001/)) aims at rethinking the concept(s) of the term **‘Bible(s)’**, on the base of past or recent discoveries (e.g. the Cairo Geniza, the [Oxyrhynchus papyri](http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/), the Nag Hammadi corpus, other European and Middle Eastern manuscript collections, rabbinic and post-rabbinic citations, and the [Dead Sea Scrolls](http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/)).

In the *introduction*, some passages help in underlining the topic of the contribution: <<...what we as moderns term ‘the Bible’ in actuality displays a wide variety of formats which feature conflicting tables of contents, different texts, variant forms of the ‘same’ texts, texts translated from diverse languages, and divergent arrangements of parts or groups of texts. These discrepancies are not minor and they make loose references to ‘the Bible’ unfortunate. Instead of ‘the Bible,’ there are ‘Bible(s),’ containing particular forms of certain texts in one or more specific arrangements used in individual communities. ... Succinctly stated, ‘the Bible’ is not and furthermore never was>> (p. 4).

*Paragraph 2* (the *pars destruens*) focuses on four basic statements:

1) <<we can no longer speak of ‘the canon’ without extensive qualifications>> (p. 5);

2) <<under these circumstances we can no longer rely upon certain longstanding and usually unquestioned assumptions about the editorial structure, the contents, the date of final formulation, and the textual integrity of those literary works presently collected together under the rubric of ‘Bible’>> (p. 8);

3) <<we can no longer speak of the ‘final form’ of any particular text>> (p. 10);

4) <<we can no longer speak of ‘the Masoretic Text’ as the benchmark of Hebrew texts which best represents a pristine original form>> (p. 11).

*Paragraph 3* (the *pars costruens*) presents four main assessments:

1) <<while the term ‘the Bible’ without qualifiers may be confusing and clumsy, the adjective ‘biblical’ still proves useful as a classificatory tool>> (p. 14);

2) <<the history of ‘books’ in the Second Temple period in their diverse textual forms is qualitatively similar to the hypothesized earlier developments in the composition of biblical texts by classical source criticism>> (p. 14);

3) <<there is an urgent need for a thoroughgoing reassessment and revision of the current terminology used in the study of early Judaism’s rich literary traditions>> (p. 15);

4) <<reading any biblical book involves a choice of reading not ‘the text,’ but one particular form of the text, one which is merely a stage in the developmental history of an ancient scroll>> (p. 17).

Here are the *conclusions*: <<The discipline of biblical studies lives and thrives today as never before. That is so even though ‘the Bible’ does not exist, if by that we mean a canonically and textually defined entity held in common by all interpreters throughout the ages. There are only Bible(s), and they all include texts which exhibit a great deal of diversity in their family history. … Yet thanks to the remarkable modern-day retrieval of a representative assemblage of Second Temple writings that had been concealed within some caves near the Dead Sea, we now have a much more nuanced grasp of the intellectual and literary environments amidst which our earliest exemplars of texts, later to be called ‘Bible,’ were emerging>> (pp. 17-18).

[This paper questinos the actual existence of a unique and definitive ‘canon’ for the Bible. Presenting many references to sources displaying texts of the Scripture outside the Masoretic ‘canon’, the author redefines the same definition of Bible, reaching the conclusion that it could be more appropriate to speak of ‘Bibles’. The analysis of the historical development to the definition of the Bible as it is known today provides the author’s idea with a solid critical background.]
