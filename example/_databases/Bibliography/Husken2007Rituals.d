«The present volume is entirely dedicated to the **investigation of the implications and effects of breaking ritual rules, of failed performances and of the extinction of ritual systems**. While rituals are often seen as infallible mechanisms which ‘work’ irrespective of the individual motivations of the performers, it is clearly visible here that rituals can fail, and that improper performances do in fact matter. These essays break new ground in their respective fields and the comparative analysis of rituals that go wrong introduces new perspectives to ritual studies. As the first book-length study on ritual mistakes and failure, this volume begins to fill a significant gap in the existing literature.» (Editor's abstract).
Particularly relevant for Buccellati's discussion is Claus Ambos' article contained in this volume, entitled "Types of Ritual Failure and Mistakes in Ritual in Cuneiform Sources" (pp. 25-47) - in which the author investigates possible mishaps attested in cuneiform sources, in particular: failures brought about by the gods refusing to accept a ritual; failures brought about the gods interrupting a ritual by their own intervention; mistakes made by human participants and the countermeasures taken to cope with them.
