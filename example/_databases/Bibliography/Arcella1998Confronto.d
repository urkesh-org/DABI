This volume collects the acts of a convention held in Bergamo, Italy in 1996. The five parts of the volume cover main areas and themes in Eliade's production: the geographical and historical context of Eliade's work; folklore and ethnographic work; eastern religious cultures; the religious history of the west; and a critical analysis of some of Eliade's major categories (sacred, hierophany, archetype, symbol, *homo religiosus*).
