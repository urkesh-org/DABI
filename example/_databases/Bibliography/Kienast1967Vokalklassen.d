Reflections based on Aro's data collection, with
stress on the importance of diachrony. Main
results: I (&#167;&#167; 9-19): vocalic alternation =
transitive, isovocalism - intransitive, or more
precisely: Transitive-fientive verbs were
originally with vocalic alternation, either *a/u* 
(occasionally changed to *u/u*) or *a/i* (occasionally
changed to *i/i*); isovocalism *i/i* was originally
for verbs of condition, *u/u* for intransitive
fientive expressing non momentary action [thus
also Von Soden 1952 (Grunririss) &#167; 87 a/c], - II
(&#167;&#167; 20-29): the same rule is also observed in
the derived stems, whereby *D* and *&#352;*, transitives,
are characterised by vocalic alternation *a/i*,
whereas *Bt* and *N* intransitives, are characterized
by isovocalism (though *N* was partly influenced
analogically by *D* and *&#352;*). -Ill (&#167;&#167; 24): isovocalism *a/a* for *B* probably served originally
to express a reflexive function, just as in *Bt*.
