In the relative clause of the type *Enlil &#353;a qib&#299;t-&#353;u kabtat*, the relative pronoun *&#353;a* is, in effect, the rectum with respect to the regens *gib&#299;t*, i.e. *&#353;a qib&#299;t-* means "of whom the command." Since the word order rectum â€” regens is not normal in Akkadian, the resumptive personal pronoun *-&#353;u* replaces the rectum after the regens: "of whom the command of him." The construction is similar to that of the inverted genitive of the type: *&#353;a Enlil qib&#299;t-&#353;u* "that of Enlil the command of him," which exhibits twice the sequence regens-rectum, using a determinative pronoun for the regens in the first case (&#353;a) and a resumptive personal pronoun for the rectum in the second case (*&#353;u*).
