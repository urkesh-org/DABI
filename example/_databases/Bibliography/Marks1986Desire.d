<<The specific subject matter of this volume is what its editor has called “theory of desire,” a term which refers to a domain of inquiry rather than to any particular set of answers. For all their diversity of content, every essay in this volume rests on the assumption that the concept of **desire** is central to some of the most important philosophical controversies of our time, which concern moral theory, the nature of mind, the philosophy of action, and other such issues>> (from editor’s *Preface*, p. ix).

This book analyses under a philosophical, anthropological, and sociological perspective the topic of **human desire**

[The volume provides the reader with a key of interpretation on the topic of the desire, also discussed by G. Buccellati in his final chapter *The Apex of Desire*.]
