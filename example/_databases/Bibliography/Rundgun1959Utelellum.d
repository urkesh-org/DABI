Differing from KIENAST 1957 "Reduplikation" R. suggests that *utlell&#363;m* and derived forms be understood as a causative in ' from a preposition *&#42;la-'alay* "above"; the result was a denominative verb with five radicals. The causative in ’ is otherwise lost in Akkadian (though common in other Sem. Languages); the prep. *l'ly* is attested in Ge‘ez *la'ala* "above," where there is also the verb *'al'ala* "to raise"; and the phenomenon of verbalisation of a preposition is possibly also present in other cases such as *na&#351;aru* < *in(a) tahr* "on the rock" > "to be high," "to look down from above.”
