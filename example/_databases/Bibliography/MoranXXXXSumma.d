In normal Akkadian *&#352;umma* occurs in the apodosis of a conditional sentence, meaning 'if'. But in EA there are a number of passages where this cannot be the meaning; a 'normal' translation would result in very rare syntactic patterns, and basically would yield little sense, or even a sense contrary to the context; upon closer examination, there is *no* apodosis, and an ellipsis would be very forced. Knudsen, guided by context, translated 'denn'; Moran, however, argues such a tranlation will not fix all cases. "In view of the comparative evidence" (not discussed here) "we retain the mor original deictic force of the particle, conventionally rendered by 'lo, behold.'" The evidence does not permit us to determine if this feature reflects Canaanite or Akkadian idiom, although Canaanite influence seems the more probable.
