TO eschatology

Foster investigates the "scanty but suggestive" Mesopotamian sources which shed light on the ancient eschatological thought - defined as «a message of hope that good will be rewarded and evil punished, or, at least, the world will be remade so as to justify a specific religious belief in the face of greater, non-believing political and military power.» (p. 25). He focuses in particular on a small group of late documents (dated to the Achaemenid and Hellenistic time), called 'prophecies' or 'apocalypses' by the scholars.

Foster identifies in these texts «a Mesopotamian background to Jewish apocalyptic, originating perhaps in Babylonia under Achaemenid rule, even as a protest to it» (p. 25). The scholar maintains that such eschatological thought was a late development in Mesopotamia, and looks for the reason for the absence of such thought in earlier times. He finds the answer in the Mesopotamian account of the Deluge: indeed, Foster maintains that, from an ancient Near Eastern perspective, the world had already ended in that remote past and therefore men were not expecting any other apocalypse. «(Third)... the flood is clearly understood ... to be a one-time event, never to recur. There was no waiting for a second flood and computing the time until it would occur. Fourth, no era of bliss followed.» (pp. 27-28).

The "end of the world" was unthinkable in the Mesopotamian view also because gods needed men to work the fields and maintain order on the earth, so that they could continue to be properly venerated, nourished, dressed and looked after in temples. Foster agrees that scholars of ancient Mesopotamia thought deeply about human suffering, but he comes to the conclusion that «a Babylonian might have considered eschatological dreams absurd, based on the experiences of real life, and possibly blasphemous, as human beings were scarcely in a position to redesign the world.» (p. 31).
