A website offering information on text (together with some edition of texts) found at [**Ebla/Tell Mardikh**](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html): <<The Ebla Digital Archives project provides scholars and students alike with an easy-to-use, yet powerful research tool for the study of the Ebla texts. Users may browse the documents individually, or query data in the most flexible way, thanks to one of the most advanced database implementation for the digital representation of cuneiform documents. An extensive, searchable, up-to-date bibliography of all Ebla material published so far complements the results>> (from website).
