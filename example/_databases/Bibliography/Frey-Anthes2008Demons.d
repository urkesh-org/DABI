<<There is no equivalent expression for the **word ‘demon’** in the Semitic languages and furthermore, in the Old Testament no conjuration ritual is mentioned. That leads to a diverse and divergent use of the term ‘demon’ in scholarly literature. The author suggests we avoid the use of the word ‘demon’ for the interpretation of Old Testament texts and Syro-Palestinian iconography. It seems to be more helpful to interpret the texts and pictures individually and to analyze the functions of the so-called ‘demons’ in their own special context>> (author’s abstract on p. 38).

[The author addresses in this paper the problem of the definition of ‘demons’ in the Bible and in the Ancient Near East, both on a philological and a conceptual level. The same topic is specifically dealt with by G. Buccellati in his volume. Both the authors randomly reach the same conclusion: a general and all-comprehensive definition of ‘demons’ in the Bible and in The Ancient Near East is elusive; therefore, the best approach is to consider each specific case as a *unicum*.]
