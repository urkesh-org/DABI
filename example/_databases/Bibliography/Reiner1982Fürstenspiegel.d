TO Fürstenspiegel; wisdom; divine wrath; Advice to a Prince

The author presents in this contribution an example of how the wisdom composition known as ***Advice to a Prince*** (see {B}R/Lambert1960Wisdom, pp. 110-115), text [DT 1](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_DT-1) (addressed, according to different opinions to the Assyrian king Sennacherib or his successor Esarhaddon), also known as ***Fürstenspiegel***, has been mentioned in a letter ([CT 54 212](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P238758)) sent to king Esarhaddon possibly by a man named Bēl-līšer of Nippur (as suggested by M. Dietrich), who reclaims about the exemptions granted to the cities of Sippar, Nippur and Babylon, which were probably negated by the king. The sender of the letter (similar to another letter from Ashurbanipal’s library at Nineveh, 12 N 110, published by M. Civil in the Appendix, pp. 324-326), reports some phrases of the *Fürstenspiegel* to persuade the king to reinstate the traditional exemptions, thus avoiding the divine wrath.

[This letter shows how ancient Mesopotamian people used sentences taken from wisdom literature in other ‘genres’, such as letters to the king, to strengthen their demands in front of their sovereign.]
