<<It is shown that the refraction near the horizon is introducing an additional bias into the **Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa**, which is able to influence the interpretation of the data. We then discuss the attempts to link certain solar eclipses to the birth of Shamshi-Adad and conclude that a record of a single solar eclipse without description of details and/or unambiguous historical links, can hardly act as a reliable anchor>> (author’s abstract on [Cornell University website](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311036)).

[This paper reviews the topic of the definition of an absolute chronology for Mesopotamian history, mostly basing on the **“Venus Tablet of [Ammisaduqa](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#588)”**, a topic discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume; cfr. also {B}R/Gurzadyan2000Astronomical; {B}R/Gurzadyan2000Chronology; {B}R/Gurzadyan2005Chronology.]
