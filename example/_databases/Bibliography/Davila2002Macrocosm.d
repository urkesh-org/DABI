The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice envisions a macrocosmos Temple conceived on the model of the **earthly Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem**. (Of course, the composers of the work would see it the other way around: the cosmos Temple is the archetype and the model for the earthly sanctuaries.) This paper seeks to reconstruct some of the implicit exegetical strategies used by the composers of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, and probably their predecessors, to support their mining of biblical accounts of the Tabernacle, the Temple in Jerusalem, and Ezekiel's imagined Temple for details of the cosmic temple.
