This essay presents narratology as a strategy for analysis of written myths. It analyses the narrative form of a written religious narrative from ancient Mesopotamia known as The **Epic of Anz√ª**, suggesting that the narrative form of myths is a necessary object of inquiry for historians of religion; one that has consequences for our understanding of the meaning and functions of myths, of the religions that make use of them, as well as for broader discussions of **religious narrative**.
