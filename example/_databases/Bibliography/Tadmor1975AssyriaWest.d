TO Ritual; prophecy; oracles

The article delineates the goals and gains of Assyria in the West prior to the time of Tiglath-pileser III, and examines the impact of the West on the culture of Assyria in the eighth and early seventh centuries BCE. The brief examination of **religious ritual** is most pertinant to the themes of our work. Tadmor mentions that under Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal, there were court prophets who addressed the king in an <<almost biblical fashion, unattested before in Mesopotamia.>> (p. 43). He is unsure of the origin of this practice: <<**prophecy in Assyria** of the seventh century is not necessarily a newly acquired Aramaic or Israelite institution. Perhaps it was an Assyrian, as versus a Babylonian, phenomenon, which Assyria shared with the West from the Amorite age.>> (p. 43) Western influence can also be discerned in the **specifically Mesopotamian practice of liver oracles**.

TO nabi; divination; baru; seer

Tadmor does not distinguish between **prophets** (*nabi*) and the technicians of **divination** (*baru*) and so may have missed the difference between Israelite prophets and partially analogous activities in Mesopotamia. The former are *called*, the latter are *seers*.
