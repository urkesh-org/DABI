TO popular/private religion; State religion

This contribution describes the dichotomy between a **popular/private religion** and the **State religion** in the ancient Near East. Besides the official gods and cultic rituals performed by State entities (the temple), in specific circumstances or occasions and within specific deputed places, in ancient Mesopotamian sources there are also glimpses (supported also by archaeological finds) on popular cults and veneration of personal or family gods.  

[This dichotomy between official (i.e. State) religion and private worshipping is not attested only in Mesopotamia; a well-known parallel can be found in Egypt during the so-called ‘Amarna period’, when, besides the official pharaonic ‘henotheism’ leading to the veneration of a unique god (Aton), the popular religion continued to worship, locally or privately, all the gods of the ‘ancient’ (i.e. traditional) Egyptian pantheon.]
