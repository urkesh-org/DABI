TO melammu (Akkadian); myths

The author's purpose is to focus, within the realm of ancient Mesopotamian religion, on the cosmology and mysticism of the *melammu* - which is defined as <<a dazzling radiance of a fearful sort associated with certain divine beings and objects>> (p. 295). Ataç believes that, in ancient Mesopotamian literature, a few instances may be identified in which an individual exposed to the sight of the *melammu* undergoes such a religious experience that he/she is ultimately transformed; the author also maintains that the mythical description of the usurpation of *melammu* from one deity to another actually alludes to shifts within the perceived cosmic power structure. In order to explain and strenghten his argument, Ataç makes use of parallels from the mythology and literature of ancient Greece.
