This paper describes the figures of demons in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia, clearly distinguishing between popular beliefs concerning these entities and later ‘canonical’ interpretation provided by literary composition which merged popular thought together with scholarly speculation of this topic.

[The author exemplifies in this contribution how, in antiquity but also today, popular beliefs contributed to the formation of scholarly compositions sometimes diverging from the original popular background or reinterpreting it through the lens of a high level cultural (i.e. scribal) tradition; the author suggests the existence of two different levels of theological interpretation of demons: popular vs. ‘official’ (i.e. literary).]
