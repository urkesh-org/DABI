A listing of data based on over 1000 texts, with emphasis on morphology, it summarizes and brings up to date earlier studies by the
author on the same subject. Some of the traits of the dialect are
masculine often used for the feminine, loss of mimation, incorrect
use of case endings, large use of the t-preterite [perfect], but
not of the t-stem (normal preterite is regular in negative statement;
in positive statement preterite and perfect are used indifferently,
according to scribal choice), occasional confusion of persons and
numbers in verbal forms, and interchange of subject and object in
syntax but only with the suffix *-&#353;un&#363;ti* (e.g *iddina&#353;&#353;unuti* "they
gave him"). These characteristics are of Babylonian, not Assirian
origin; the spoken language was East Hurrian, which comes through
especially in loanwords (see a long section on this pp. 51-63).
