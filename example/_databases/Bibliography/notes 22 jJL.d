TO Resurrection; Tammuz; Jesus

At least since the time of Frazer's *The Golden Bough*, some have suggested that "dying and rising gods" are a leitmotif in many or all religions. This thesis and the evidence used to support it has been largely discredited as approximate or even simply false. See one critique in Frankfort *Kingship and the Gods*, pp. 286-294. Frankfort admonishes that <<it is through the specifically different, not through the generically alike, that we may understand them.>> (p. 294). See also {B}R/Frankfort1958DyingGod.
