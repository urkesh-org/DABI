TO prophets

In this miscellaneous volume, the authors present a comparison between figures of **prophets** (and their connection to the royal power) in **Mesopotamia** and **Israel**. The different contributions further stress the basic similarities and differences between these two worlds, mainly due to the different social, religious, and political background of Mesopotamia and Israel, shaping two different figures of prophets (with peculiar roles and purposes).
