TO Mesopotamian chronology

<<The objective of the present study is to present a new, coherent scheme for **Mesopotamian chronology** during the second millennium. Because Susa is one of the few excavated sites that shows a continuity in occupation between the time of the fall of Babylon and c. 1400 BC and, in addition, yields ceramic information for the Babylonian corpus, we also connect the Elamite chronology with the Babylonian system of dating. On the other hand, although the absolute chronologies throughout the Ancient Near East are largely dependent on Babylonian data, they are given less consideration here because the archaeological evidence from there areas is only remotely related to the stemming from Mesopotamia and therefore lies outside the scope of this study>> (from authors’ *Praface*, p. 2). 

[This volume enriches the discussion that G. Buccellati presents in his volume about the definition of a Mesopotamian chronology based on astronomical observations.]
