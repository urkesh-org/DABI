Short contributions of which the following are of interest for Akkadian: 1. Middle weak roots were originally biconsonantal with short vowel, successively lengthened when accented in open syllable; 2. Affirmative elemnts of reflexive conjugation are objective pronominal particles, those of causative are not subjective (nominative) or agential; 3. The personal pronoun of the first pers. sing. at the beginning is not appositional (vs. Poebel) because in some South Semitic inscriptions the pronoun is not followed by any resumptive; 4. Poebel's etymology of *q&#257;tu* "hand" from *lqh* "to take" cannot be accepted.
