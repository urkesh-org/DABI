An attempt to define the most marked characteristics of the Akkadian written at Alalakh, including the orthography, phonology, morphology, and syntax, as seen in Smith *Id-Rimi* and Wiseman *Alalakh*. Classifies the language as 'Mitanni Akkadian,' rather similar to that of Nuzi. Lists the differences betwen Nuzi and Alalakh, and the features differentiating Nuzi and Akkad, is somewhat more archaic (at least in the older layer) than Nuzi, and stratum was predominantly Hurrian. States that the Akkad, in such border areas changes; Assyrian, however, seems to have had only a very slight influence on Mitanni Akkad, despite its geographical proximity.
