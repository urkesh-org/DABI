General criticism of Weinhof&#39;s notion of polarity, stated as follows: "If under certain conditions A becomes B, B will become A under the same conditions." Specific areas of criticism are among others, broken plurals (no single contrasting pair because one singular has many plurals), and the West-Semitic tense system which should be explained on the basis of the underlying sentence type.
