The change *&#353;&#353;* > *ss* is due neither to phonetic dissimilation (because *&#353;&#353;* is in fact often attested) nor to analogy with changes which can be explained phonetically, e.g. *t&#353;* > *ss*. Rahter, it is due to the desire of avoiding the ambiguity resulting from the fact that *n&#353;* also yields, in certain cases, *&#353;&#353;* ; i.e., *&#353;&#353;* < *n&#353;* was differentiated from original *&#353;&#353;* in that the latter became *ss*. The rule for the change *n&#353;* > *&#353;&#353;* is that the change occurs regularly except when the vowel preceding *n* is etymologically long (e.g. *&#299;n-&#353;u*) or when the word before the suffix contains a sibilant (e.g. *uzun-&#353;u*).
