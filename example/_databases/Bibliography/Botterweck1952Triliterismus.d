After a detailed history of the problem of triconsonantal and biconsonantal roots, a lexical
analysis of the Semitic words containing gl, kl and ql is given, with the conclusion that they must all be
reduced to a set of basic meanings closely connected with one another: "to resound" "to roll % be
round" "to move." There follows a discussion of the processes by which actual words are differentiated
by enlargement from the biconsonantal roots: reduplication, lengthening of middle vowel or of second
consonant, root-formative consonants ("Wurzelformantien": s, h,', n, m, t). The last section attributes
psychological functions to acoustic realizations so that e.g. voiced velars are taken to indicate weight or
slow motion (p. 62); on the basis of this criterion further lexical categorizations are given of words from
the roots g/k/ql and b/pr, and the conclusion is reached that words with voiced consonants are closer
to the original meaning of the root (p. 64, 66). In the concluding chapter the author stresses the
historical reality of the biconsonantal root.
