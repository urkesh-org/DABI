TO Inanna’s dedicatory inscriptions

<<In this article, I propose a holistic interpretation of a well-defined corpus of third millennium BC inscribed artefacts, focusing on the relationships between text (format and content), the artefact, and its original destination and deposition. I aim to underline the social dimension of inscribed objects and, in general, of writing in votive depositional contexts. As a case study, I have focused on the **inscribed artefacts found in level VIIB of the Inanna Temple at Nippur**. This small corpus of approximately twenty-two objects shows many peculiarities, most prominent of which are the high number of female donors and the lack of royal inscriptions. >> (author’s abstract on p. 27).

[The paper investigates the function and religious meaning of dedicatory inscriptions from the Early Dynastic Inanna Temple at Nippur, mostly focusing on their archaeological context and on the relationship between the inscription itself and its donor, stressing the importance of dedicatory inscriptions left by privates.]
