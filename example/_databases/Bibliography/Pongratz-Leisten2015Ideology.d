The purpose of this volume is to trace **the development of Assyrian ideological discourse** from the third millennium BC to the seventh century BC, by analysing texts, ritual practices, and images. In Chapter 1, Pongratz-Leisten describes the methodological issues, the history of research, and declares that her main goal is to explore "dynamics between religion and ideological discourse" (p. 40) in Assyria. She is careful to highlight that she focuses not only on Mesopotamia proper but also on those cultural interactions with Syrian and Anatolian cultures which influenced the ideology under inspection: in doing so, the author often mentions Urkesh and the publications by Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati. Chapters 2 to 4 outline chronologically the process by which the Assyrian ideological discourse came to life, from a historical (Chapter 2) cultural (Chapter 3) as well as ideological (Chapter 4) perspective. The following chapters (5 to 10) explore various issues in Assyrian royal ideology, and they are the most relevant and useful to compare with Buccellati's discourse on religion. Chapter 5 examines the royal titles and symbols connected to the Assyrian kings; chapter 6 analyzes the relationship between Assyrian royal ideology and myth - in particular with regard to the divine figure of Ninurta; chapter 7 considers the way in which royal inscriptions were used and included in the royal discourse and propaganda, while chapter 8 focuses on the intertextuality between historiographic texts and myths. Finally, chapter 9 investigates the issues of prophecy and divination compendia while chapter 10 discusses to what extent Assyrian cultic practice and rituals were used to reinforce or create the royal ideology. In the last chapter, 11, the author highlights the role of the scholars within the Assyrian kingship. The book also has two appendices, in which Pongratz-Leisten offers a transliteration, philological commentary and analysis of two Akkadian texts: LKA 62 and Rm 2, 455.
Several significant topics discussed by Buccellati are investigated in this book: two issues in particular will be mentioned here. Firstly, the **nature and function of rituals** (Buccellati's §13.1) and the **relationship between religion and politics** (Buccelati's §16.2), which are clearly very relevant issues in the history of the Neo-Assyrian empire. Overall, the examples provided by Pongratz-Leisten seems to confirm Buccellati's statements that «Religious rituals serve to institutionalize individual efforts to establish an interactive link with the divine element» (§13.1) - and that «religion is politics because it offers mechanisms that serve to give integration to the social group, and politics is religion because it offers an effective model of world integration.» (§16.2). In particular, Pongratz-Leisten's analysis of the *t&#257;kultu* and the *ak&#299;tu* rituals (in her §10.3.2, pp. 392ff and §10.5, pp. 416ff) strongly highlights the connections between royal ideology and the Neo-Assyrian cosmological view. «The Assyrian state rituals of the Sargonid period are a powerful mechanism for publicizing the *body politic* of the king in his cosmic function (…) **Myth and ritual were a key part of cultural discourse and were as important as pragmatic action in the consolidation and stabilization of Assyrian power and control**, both in the imperial heartland and in the provinces. Myth and ritual were powerful means for visualizing and negotiating the asymmetrical power relationships represented by the monarchical system, and (…) they were carefully orchestrated to reinforce the king's historical and cosmic role» (pp. 390-391).
The second significant issue discussed by the author is the Assyrian perception of **polytheism**, in particular at pp. 404-407. In this case, similarly to when Buccellati argues for an increasing development of a "unity of the divine" (§5.2; see also §3.2, §3.3 and §5.1) Pongratz-Leisten maintains that hyphenation in the Assyrian cultic context (e.g. Aššur-Adad, Aššur-Ninurta, Aššur-Enlil) should be understood as a variation of the theological "summodeism", i.e. «a form of theism in which **deities are regarded as aspects or functions of a chief god**, with political power often key to its expression (…) Polytheism reflects this kind of coherent system of action (Handlungssystem) in which every divinity contributes according to their skill-set to guarantee the functioning of the cosmic order (…) In the summodeism of the god lists or hymns of the first millennium BC, the accumulation of various roles, functions, and qualities in one deity marks the developing consolidation of divine power in one divine agency.» (pp. 404-406)
Instead, one rather strong statement which is present in this volume and that goes against what is argued by Buccellati in §2.4 and §17.2 - as well as elsewhere in the volume -, is that «ancient Near Eastern knowledge is primarily practical rather than moral or philosophical» (pp. 273-274). The author uses this argument to discuss the royal ideological discourse on knowledge developed over time, in particular by Esarhaddon, to legitimize kingship. Unfortunately, however, she does not develop further this statement nor does she describe her own perception of "philosophy" and "morality", particularly when applied to Ancient Mesopotamia.
