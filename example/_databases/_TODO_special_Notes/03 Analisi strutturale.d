$$ i 15 ^gB

My reading of *Anšar Anum bukrašu umaššil* is: "Anšar made Anum, his son, a copy (of himself)." Similarly [Foster 1996 *Before*](b#Foster1996Before), 1, p. 353: "Anshar made Anu, his offspring, (his) equal."

Differently *CAD M/1* p. 357 and Lambert 2013 *Myths*, p. 51: they interpret the line as "Anu, the son, equalled Anšar." This is less likely because it seems preferable to take the D stem as a factitive, and to take the accusative *bukrašu* at face value, as the object of the verb.


$$ i 21-24 ^gB ZD3

L'alternanza di permansivi (sottolineati in quanto segue) e preteriti è significativa e va messa in luce:

~~										| ~~
----------------------------------------|------------------------------
*innendūma athū ilānū*					| "the gods *congregated* as comrades do and"
> *ešū Tiamat-ma*						| > "were <u>*in a state of confusion*</u> that affected Tiamat because"
>> *nāşiršunū ištappū*					| >> "they *kept jumping* making a huge clamor";
*<u>dalhunim-ma</u> ša Tiamat karassa*	| "they <u>were in a state of great agitation</u> and so"
> *ina šuarī <u>šu'durū</u>*			| > "they were full of anxiety with their dancing"
>> *qirib Anduruna*						| >> "in the midst of Anduruna"


*ištappū*: I take this as the third person plural of the Btn stem of *šapū*, "to surge up and down," and *nāşiršunū* as an accusative of relation, "with their noise."

*nāşirum* is rare, and is used here as an arcane word; its meaning as "clamor" is derived from lexical lists




$$ v 3 ^gB ZD3

*u’addī šattam mişrāti umaşşir* "he made known (the nature of) the year, defined the boundaries (of time)

*u’addī*:  D-stem from *idū* "to make known," equivalent to "revealing"

*umaşşir* D-stem from *maşāru*, a denominative from *mişru* "boundary" (*AHw* p. 620 A), hence "to make a boundary," which is etymologically the equivalent of "to define" (from Latin *finis* "boundary"); another equivalent would be "to circumscribe its inner divisions," as is made clear by the following verse: "he established three stars for each of the twelve months."
