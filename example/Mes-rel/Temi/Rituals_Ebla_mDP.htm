&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper analyses the occurrence of some peculiar terms connected to specific <b>cultic activities</b> performed at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author starts outlining these recurrent elements:<br>
<ol>
<li>the presence of specific priests (namely <b>PA<sub>4</sub>:&#352;E&#352; [= <i>pa&#353;&#299;&#353;u</i>]</b>, and <b>A:NAGA [<i>&#700;&#224;-a-um</i> = <i>el&#275;lum</i>] &#201; EN</b> 'purificator priest of the lord's house');</li>
<li>an offering, <b>N&#205;DBA</b> or <b>N&#205;G.BA</b> (sometimes consisting of textiles, such as the <b><i>ma&#353;-da-b&#249;</b></i>, a 'wool textile') to the god <b><sup>d</sup>Kura</b> (the polyad deity of Ebla);</li>
<li>the syntagma <b>DU<sub>11</sub>.GA</b>, 'order, vow', 'request' (and variants <b>KA.DI.II</b> and <b>KA.G&#193;.II</b> = <b><i>rag&#257;mum</b></i> = <b><i>b&#226;lum</b></i>, 'recited prayer') <b><i>i-sa-r&#237;</b></i> (with variants <b><i>i-sa-i</b></i> and <b><i>i-s&#225;-r&#237;</b></i> = <b><i>i&#353;&#257;rum</b></i>, 'to be favorable' [from a root meaning 'normal, right']);</li>
<li>the presence of the term <b><i>da-mi-mu</b></i> (and variants; translated with 'reciter, lamenter').</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stressed by the author, "il valore che tali elementi assumono sia sulla base del significato di alcune parole chiave, come indicato dalle liste lessicali di Ebla, sia sulla base dell'analisi prosopografica, suggerisce l'individuazione di un atto di culto" ("the value that these elements assume is based on the meaning of some keywords, as indicated by Ebla's lexical lists, both on the basis of prosopographic analysis, suggests the identification of an act of worship"; English translation by mDP) [p. 131].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the article, the author presents many texts from Ebla (mainly <i>ARET</i> 1.13, <i>ARET</i> 1.14, <i>ARET</i> 3.400, <i>ARET</i> 3.497, <i>ARET</i> 4.4, <i>ARET</i> 4.21, <i>ARET</i> 4.22, <i>ARET</i> 8.529, <i>ARET</i> 8.542, <i>ARET</i> 4.16, <i>ARET</i> 3.192, TM.75.G.1399, <i>ARET</i> 1.10, <i>ARET</i> 3.139, <i>ARET</i> 4.17, <i>ARET</i> 1.15) trying to better determine the exact meaning of the aforementioned elements, also providing a relative chronology as the examined terminology, thus investigating the <b>diachronic development</b> of the present ritual.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main results of such an analysis are outlined on pp. 139-140: "Confrontando questi dati con la distribuzione dei sumerogrammi KADI.II/KAG&#193;.II e DU<sub>11</sub>.GA nelle espressioni in esame, si ricava che KADI.II <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i> (e variante) &#232; la formula usata nei passi di datazione alta ..., mentre DU<sub>11</sub>.GA <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i> &#232; la formula dei passi recenti. Si pu&#242; allora concludere: a) che il parallelismo delle due espressioni si riferisce in effetti ad uno stesso atto di culto, come suggerito dalla presenza costante di <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i>; b) che ad entrambe pu&#242; essere attribuito un significato 'preghiera di buona fortuna'; c) che il modo con cui questo atto cultuale viene citato nei testi ha per&#242; subito un'evoluzione terminologica;  d) che tale evoluzione potrebbe non essere meramente convenzionale, bens&#236; sostanziale, qualora potesse essere messa in relazione con quanto osservato pi&#249; oltre ... circa la correlazione delle due espressioni con due differenti sacerdoti" ("By comparing these data with the distribution of the sumerograms KADI.II/KAG&#193;.II and DU<sub>11</sub>.GA in the expressions under examination, it is found that KADI.II <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i> (and variant) is the formula used in the passages of high dating ..., while DU<sub>11</sub>.GA <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i> is the formula of more recent texts. We can therefore conclude: a) that the parallelism of the two expressions refers in fact to the same act of worship, as suggested by the constant presence of <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i>; b) that both the expressions mean a 'good luck prayer'; c) that the way in which this cultic act is mentioned in the texts has however undergone a terminological evolution; d) that this evolution may not be merely conventional, but substantial, if it could be related to what was observed further on ... about the correlation of the two expressions with two different priests"; English translation by mDP).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On p. 147 the author offers an index of all the mentioned passages.<br>
<br>
<small>[This paper is noteworthy as a specimen of methodology, showing a philological accuracy in the analysis of the original terminology (Sumerian and Akkadian) referring to specific cultic activities, priestly figures involved in rites, and peculiar offerings to the gods of the Eblaite pantheon. The philological scrupulousness strengthens the analysis, avoiding any superposition of modern concepts far from the original mind of ancient Mesopotamian worshippers.]</small>

"L'arch&#233;ologie du culte&nbsp;:&nbsp;les anc&#234;tres royaux dans la documentation arch&#233;ologique d'&#201;bla et les t&#233;moignages textuels d'Ougarit",<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper describes, through the analysis of both the archaeological and textual evidence, the <b>ritual activities</b> related to the cult of the <b>royal ancestors</b> (called [<b><i>Rapi&#700;uma</b></i> or <A href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rephaim"><b><i>Repha&#700;im</b></i></a> in texts from <A href="https://www.ancient.eu/ugarit/"><b>Ugarit/Ras Shamra</b></a>, later interpreted as <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manes"><b><i>Manes</b></i></a>, at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>, from Ancient Bronze IVA (ca. 2400-2300 BC) to Iron Age II (ca. 900-720 BC).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BA IVA texts found in the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html_tablets"><b>Royal Archives of Ebla</b></a> mention the <b>divinisation</b> of the dead kings and the cult offered to the royal ancestors: the <b>'Ritual of the Regality'</b> (L. 2769, ca. 2350-2300 BC), from the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/escavi__il_palazzo_reale_g.html"><b>Royal Palace G</b></a>, interpreted as an <b>enthronement ritual</b> or a ritual performed on the occasion of the <b>royal marriage</b>, mentions a three-week celebration involving a procession of the royal couple (escorted by the statues of <b>Kura</b> and <b>Barama</b>) to the site of <b>Binash</b> (a royal necropolis), presenting offerings to the royal ancestors, mentioned by their names: this ritual was celebrated once the royal couple came back to Ebla.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another text mentions an <b>offering</b> of ten rams to ten different <b>deified kings</b>, from Abur-Lim to Irkab-Damu (see the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kings_of_Ebla">List of kings of Ebla</a>), and another offering of rams to some 'gods' residing at <A href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=36.1389,36.83&q=36.1389,36.83&hl=en&t=m&z=12"><b>Darib</b>/[<b>Atareb(?)</b></a> (another royal necropolis).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these offering presented in sites located outside Ebla, some <b>administrative texts</b> also reports offerings presented in the Royal Palace to the DINDIR EN ('the god of the king'), to the DINGIR <i>maliktum</i> ('the god of the queen'), or to the DINGIR <i>a-mu</i> ('the god of the father'), revealing a specific royal cult not involving the royal ancestors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993 excavation campaign, the archaeologists uncovered the so-called <b>'Western Unit of the Central Complex'</b>, in the area of the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/escavi__il_palazzo_reale_g.html"><b>Royal Palace G</b></a>, revealing the presence of the <b>Hypogeum G4</b> (insisting on areas L. 5762 and L. 6402), dating to BA IVA: the place, found completely empty, was interpreted as an unutilized tomb of a king (possibly Ishar-Damu or another successor), or also perhaps of the royal couple (as it could be confirmed by analysing a precious <b>royal standard</b> found in the royal storeroom, displaying the young queen Tabur-Dumu and the queen-mother Dusigu), or even for one of the 'greats' of the royal administration (e.g. Ibbi-Zikir); this interpretation can be confirmed by the term <b>&#201;&#215;PAP</b> ('tomb') attested on an economic document (TM.75.G.2596) of the time of the vizier Ibrium, registering the delivery of 2.136 kg of gold "for the tomb of the king". Whatever the correct interpretation is, it is possible to envisage in the construction of the Hypogeum G4 an <i>ideological revolution</i> in the conception of the kingship at Ebla, stressing the imperial ambitions of the king who decided to be engraved under his own palace and not in a burial site outside the city.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, during the Middle Bronze I-II (ca. 200-1600 BC), the city further expanded outside the citadel: in the <b>area Q of the Western Palace</b>, in 1978-1979 three hypogea were discovered, labelled as <b>'Tomb of the Cisterns'</b>, <b>'Tomb of the Princess'</b>, and <b>'Tomb of the Lord of the Goats'</b>, the last probably belonging to king <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immeya">Immeya</a>; these tombs can be dated between MB IB and MB IIA, i.e. ca. 1850-1700 BC. In the 'Tomb of the Lord of the Goats', an object in bone interpreted as a <b>funerary talisman</b> was found: on the obverse, it shows a <b>funerary banquet</b>, while on the reverse a human-head bull is depicted, adorated by two cynocephalics; these two scenes are interpreted as the topic moment of the <b>royal funeral</b>, i.e. the assumption of the king among the other deified predecessors (the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i>). Furthermore, the location of these tombs, along the western side of the mound, could be interpreted as a reference to the West, the place of the sunset, perceived as the real of the deceased; in fact, the tombs are close to the area of the temple of <A href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/reshef"><i>Rashap</i></a>, the god of the Underworld (it is noteworthy that in this temple a ritual basaltic basin was found [dated to MB IB, i.e. ca. 1900-1800 BC], showing a similar banquet scene, involving the adoration of the king). The ritual banquet scene has been interpreted as the Mesopotamian <b><i>kispum</b></i>, where the actual king and his deified ancestors shared the ritual banquet.<br>         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, <b>Ugaritic texts</b> of the Late Bronze Age II (such as the KTU 1.20-22, labelled as <b>'Poem of the Rapi'uma'</b>, possibly a portion of the <A href="https://books.google.it/books?id=dXH4CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA81&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">'Tale of Aqhat'</a>) tell us about myths and rituals involving the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i>, i.e. the royal deified ancestors, participating in ritual banquets. This interpretation of the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i> with the royal ancestors is confirmed by another text (KTU 1.61, <b>'The Book for the Banquet of the Shadows'</b>), where the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i> escorts the dead king (<A href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#9094">Niqmaddu III</a>) to the Underworld. Two other texts (KTU 1.108 and KTU 1.124) report two sumptuous banquets of the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i> at the presence respectively of the goddess <A href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/TEMI/mesopotamian_gods_mDP.htm#Anat"><b>Anat</b></a> and of <b>Ditanu</b>, a mythical hero fighting to ensure a long descendance to the reigning dynasty.<br>     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in 1964-1965 and 1971-1972 excavations in the lower city, the structure of the <b>Sanctuary B2</b> (MB II, ca. 1800-1600 BC) was uncovered, a building showing a peculiar architecture including a wide room clearly adhibited to ritual banquets (probably something similar to the North-West Semitic <b><i>marzeah</b></i> (see e.g. <A href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23621930">King 1989</a> or to the Mesopotamian <b><i>kispum</b></i> (see e.g. <A href="https://www.academia.edu/10355375/Remembrance_and_the_Dead_in_Second_Millennium_BC_Mesopotamia_full_text">Mac Dougal 2014</a>[]())) with many participants; such an interpretation is stressed by the finding of peculiar places with <b>altars</b> flanked by two <i>antae</i> (probably hosting a cultic statue), the presence of a large <b>podium</b> in a central position, and by the proximity of the aforementioned place to a room where cooking activities took place. These banquets were performed on the occasion of the death of the reigning king, to guarantee him the assumption among the ancestors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, a <b>steatite cylindrical seal</b> kept in the Erlenmeyer Collection (Paleo-Assyrian period, unknown provenance) depicts three scenes involving the divinities of <A href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#6054">Yamkhad</a> and the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i> of <A href="https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/540/mode/2up">Halab</a>, probably on the occasion of the death of a Syrian king.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, reporting the author's own words: "La tradition de la divinisation des rois d&#233;funts et la foi dans une protection essentielle fournie par ces &#234;tres divinis&#233;s &#224; la communaut&#233; des vivants, &#224; la maison r&#233;gnante et &#224; l'ensemble de la soci&#233;t&#233;, remontent, en Syrie, aux d&#233;buts m&#234;mes de la vie urbaine, &#224; l'&#233;poque protosyrienne et au grand essor d'&#201;bla &#224; l'apog&#233;e de la &#171;&nbsp;seconde urbanisation&nbsp;&#187;, peu apr&#232;s la moiti&#233; du IIIe mill&#233;naire av. J.-C., quand les rituels des Archives royales t&#233;moignent le r&#244;le des rois morts divinis&#233;s dans le renouvellement des rois r&#233;gnants" ("The tradition of deification of deceased kings and the faith in an essential protection provided by these deified beings to the community of the living, the reigning house, and the whole society, go back, in Syria, to the very beginning of urban life, in Proto-Syrian times and in the sudden growth of Ebla at the acme of the "second urbanization", shortly after the middle of the third millennium BC, when the rituals of the Royal Archives testify to the role of the deified dead kings in the renewal of the reigning kings" [p. 991; English translation by mDP]).<br>
<br>
<small>[The approach and data presented by the author fully involve the present volume of G. Buccellati: through the analysis of both textual and archaeological evidence, P. Matthiae reconstructs ancient ritual practices performed at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a> and <A href="https://www.ancient.eu/ugarit/"><b>Ugarit/Ras Shamra</b></a>. The aforementioned approach, also involving Biblical tradition, perfectly exemplifies G. Buccellati's comparative approach as described in the present volume.]<br>
<br>
[On the topic of 'divinised kings': in this paper, P. Matthiae outlines some clues hinting to a divinization of dead kings at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>. In Chapter 15, Section 5 of his book on Mesopotamian religion, G. Buccellati presents a slightly different opinion on the topic of 'divinised kings': "The explicit divinization of the king is a phenomenon that rarely happens in Mesopotamia, and above all it never plays a structural or institutional role, but remains as an extreme form of glorification. But it is certain that royalty as an institution is "divinized", while the priesthood in its various forms never is. If a specific king is not deified as an individual, he is deified, we can say, as the holder of royal power, and only as long as the power actually remains under his control. It is a way of defining the parameters of political legitimacy" (English translation by mDP). This discrepancy can be explained considering that for G. Buccellati is the royalty itself to be eventually 'divinized', while the 'divinization' of dead kings represents a form of 'glorification' only.]</small>

1995<br>
"Rituals at Ebla",<br>
<i>Journal of Near Eastern Studies</i> 54/3, pp. 215-222.<br>
[Online PDF version at this <A href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/PDF/Vigan&#242;1995.pdf">link</a>]<br> 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since 1988, several articles have been published focusing on rituals performed in the ancient city of <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>. ... All these works, directly or indirectly, deal with religious ceremonies. Thus, the question arises concerning which kinds of festivals are recorded in the administrative texts, which rituals routinely took place at Ebla, and, finally, whether listed items used for a sacred purpose refer to the same ritual or describe common elements occurring in different liturgies. ... This paper has the very restricted goal of studying a number of those rituals registered in the administrative records" (p. 215).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author presents in this paper some ritual texts from the Archives of the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/escavi__il_palazzo_reale_g.html"><b>Royal Palace G</b></a> at Ebla: the <i>Purification Ritual L. 2679</i>(pp. 215-219), <i>rituals of Regular Offerings</i> (dug<sub>4</sub>-ga <i>i-sa-r&#237; / i-sa-i</i>, and other terms, see <i>infra</i>) (pp. 219-221), and the so-called 'a:tu<sub>5</sub> ritual' (p. 221).<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ritual presents four key-elements (p. 216), already investigated in <A href="#Bonechi1989">Bonechi 1989</a>:<br>
<ol>
<li>the presence of a 'purification priest', called A:NAGA = a:tu<sub>5</sub>, <i>contra</i> Vigan&#242;, interpreting this term as referring not to the priest but to the ritual itself, concerning the purification of the king's household (pp. 216-217);</li>
<li>the offering to the god <sup>d</sup>KU-<i>ra</i>; according to Vigan&#242;, this offering was performed by a priest carrying the title 'pa<sub>4</sub>:&#353;e&#353; (= <i>pa&#353;i&#353;u</i>) <sup>d</sup>KU-<i>ra</i>';</li>
<li>its association with dug<sub>4</sub>-ga <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i> (and its variants), probably offering consisting of garments and wool (defined in other texts as 'n&#237;g-ba <i>a-du-lu</i>', 'gift of Adulu');</li>
<li>the spelling of <i>da-mi-mu</i> (and its variants).</li>
</ol>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Regular Offerings</i>-ritual is then discussed, starting with the different spelling of the term (cf. <A href="#Bonechi1989">Bonechi 1989</a>): 'KA.DI-2 = s&#225;.dug<sub>4</sub>-2', 'KA-G&#193;-2', and 'dug<sub>4</sub>-ga', always appearing with the same gloss '<i>i-sa-r&#237; / i-sa-i</i>', i.e. 'regular'. From the first of these terms, 'KA.DI-2 = s&#225;.dug<sub>4</sub>-2', it derived the regular form 's&#225;.dug<sub>4</sub>-ga' (attested on L. 2712), glossed '<i>zi-gi-nu</i>' in other texts and interpreted by Milano (<A href="https://www.arborsapientiae.com/libro/1710/testi-amministrativi-assegnazioni-di-prodotti-alimentari-archivio-l-2712-parte-1-archivi-reali-di-ebla-testi-ix--lucio-milano.html"><i>ARET</i> 9</a>, p. 402) as deriving from the Semitic <i>&#353;kn</i>, 'to provide' (<i>et al.</i>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, as for the 'a:tu<sub>5</sub> ritual', the author stresses  how "the presentation of the main elements of the so-called a:tu<sub>5</sub> ritual prompts the legitimate question of whether all these segments belong to one ceremony, even though they are registered in the MAT reports as separate items. ... I think it would not be wrong to join Bonechi (see <A href="#Bonechi1989">Bonechi 1989</a>) in stating that they are parts of the same ceremony and that it probably took place in the temple of the Ebla patron deities" (p. 221).<br>
<br>
<small>[The author discusses in this paper the actual realisations of religious practices at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>, analysing the textual sources with a strict philological approach. This is a clear exemplification of how ancient religious practices can be reconstructed on the base of ancient texts. On the same topic, cf. <A href="#Vigano2000">Vigan&#242; 2000</a>]</small>

The a:tu<sub>5</sub> ritual was performed at the beginning of every year as a memorial of the same 'purification of the king's household' carried out during the long and complex enthronement ritual ... . Evidence of this event can also be found in TM 1730, 'the Annual Report of Expenditures (<i>ARE</i>) of the thirteenth year, the third from the last of <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrium">Ibrium</a>'s leadership, in which the crowning of the last Ebla king (en) took place" (p. 13).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author investigates in this contribution the ritual text TM 1730 (see <i>supra</i>), comparing this document with other <b>purification rituals</b>, such as the '&#236;-gi&#353; sag ritual', whose actual performance has been discussed (some scholars interpreted it as a proper 'purification ritual', while others have advanced the interpretation of purification ritual performed before the <b>anointing</b> of the head).<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Paragraph 3</i> (pp. 20-22) is devoted to the analysis of the <b>sikil-ritual</b>, 'the purification, cleansing ceremony', presenting texts from the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html_tablets"><b>Royal Archives of Ebla</b></a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author specifically underlings the connection between the a:tu<sub>5</sub>-ritual with the crowning of the new king ('en') at Ebla: more in detail, text TM 1730 specifies the gifts the divinity was provided with, during this ritual action: 'silver, a bracelet, and a she-goat'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the '&#236;-gi&#353; sag-ritual' concerns the use not of water but of <b>oil</b> (&#236;-gi&#353;), during the ritual action of the anointment of the new enthroned king (a practice well attested both in the Bible and also in the sacral consecration of a new bride of the Egyptian pharaohs, such in the case of the first Hittite marriage between Ramses II and a daughter of the Hittite king &#7722;attu&#353;ili III, see e.g. text KUB XXVI 53 (<A href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/hetkonk/hetkonk_abfrage.php?c=735">CTH 735</a>), and also in the Amarna correspondence, in a letter between Amenhotep III and Tar&#7723;undaradu, king of Arzawa (<A href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/hetkonk/hetkonk_abfrage.php?c=151">CTH 151 = EA 31</a>). This practice of anointing the head of the new king was perpetrated during the Middle Ages, when a new sovereign was anointed by the Pope with the sacred Chrism, a ritual also well known as for any <b>baptism</b> in the Catholic Church tradition (see e.g. <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm">The Catechism of the Holy Church</a>, under no. 1241). The author reports some instances when the performing of the anointment ritual was the topic (pp. 16-18). In some cases, a similar ritual was applied to <b>funerary ceremonies</b>, too, as described on pp. 18-19.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the use of oil for ritual purposes streams from very older traditions, as it  was described in detail in <A href="https://http://urkesh.org/attach/Recht%202014%20perfume.pdf">Recht 2014</a>, mainly for what concerns ritual aspects and practices at <A href="http://urkesh.org">Urkesh/Tell Mozan</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Paragraph 3</i> deals, on the other hand, with the 'cleansing ceremonies' practised at Ebla, called in Akkadian <b>'sikil'-ritual(s)</b>. The following quotation by Vigan&#242; seems to be very effective in explaining such a ritual: "Almost all the examples referring to this ritual are derived from the <i>ARE</i> reports that register the amounts of gold and silver used to manufacture objects offered to different deities during the illness of some important member of the Ebla upper class" (p. 21). Hence, it is clear that gold and silver (as uninstructive elements), were perceived by ancient people as a 'symptom' of pureness and of sacral libation grated to the gods.<br>            
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly concluding: "'The anointing of the head' (&#236;-gi&#353; sag ritual) is not restricted to use in a funerary ceremony. Such a practice is performed for weddings and other occasions in which oil does not play the role of a cleansing element but is part of a ceremony of joy and celebration. Finally, the 'purification' (sikil) is performed in cases of <b>illness</b> that sometimes ended in death" (p. 22).<br>

<small>[This paper deals with actual realisations of religious practices at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>, mostly for what concerns the use of oil in rituals, analysing the textual sources with a strict philological approach. This is a clear exemplification of how ancient religious practices can be reconstructed on the base of ancient texts, comparing them also with Biblical passages or with other Near Eastern textual evidence.
