<h2><A name="gB">2 Giorgio Buccellati's view</a></h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giorgio Buccellati investigates the topic of rituals in Ancient Near East and Israel under a structural comparison, specifically in two chapters of his book "When on High the Heavens...": chapter 18, on magic and rituals for the individual, and chapter 22, on cults performed at an institutional level.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "bi-polarity" of the discussion on rituals (considered as both referring to an individual and an institutional level) is clearly exemplified in the following table (from Giorgio Buccellati's book, chapter 7, section 2: <i>Table of topics</i><a name="*ToC">*</a>):<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I briefly report here some passages from these two chapers, useful at better defining Giorgio Buccellati's structural comparison.<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="13">2.1 Chapter 13: <i>Magic and rituals for the individual</i></a></b></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Nature and function of rituals</b><a name="*7">*</a>: &#147;Religious rituals serve to institutionalize individual efforts to establish an interactive link with the divine element. They are pre-established channels through which man perceives the affecting presence of the absolute. And this interaction is, at the same time, the main safeguard of universal order, because the individual feels that he or she is part of this greater order and thus is able to integrate himself or herself into it&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Ritual vs. ritualism = formalism</b>: &#147;All this is not to be understood as a vague generalization, but rather as a concrete way to arrive at a better understanding of the cognitive supports that serve as a common denominator for a vast complex of rituals that otherwise may appear as very disparate phenomena. It also helps us to appreciate the deeper religious value of practices that might otherwise appear merely as automatic and mechanistic routines, without any real spiritual content&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Occasions for rituals (their context)</b>: &#147;These rites are operative in particular junctures in the life of each individual: birth<a name="*14">*</a>, sexual maturity, psychological and physical crises (like an illness), death. Before considering the rituals in their specificity, we must pause to consider two dimensions that will help us better understand the purpose of ritual in itself: the confirmation of the relationship with the divine element and the restoration of order when it is broken.&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Similarities and differences between ANE and Israel</b>: &#147;A fundamental dimension of the sacrificial act is that transference goes only in one direction: what is made sacred cannot be reversed, and must now be treated as belonging definitively to the new ontological sphere. In this sense, there is a substantial similarity between the Mesopotamian and Biblical worlds, and external aspects of the ritual are equally comparable. Where a profound difference emerges instead is from the point of view of fruition&#148;.</li>
<ul><li><b>ANE: gods' need for sacrifices (+)</b><a name="*20">*</a> <a href="#Note2"><sup>Note 2</sup></a><a name="Back2a"></a>: &#147;In Mesopotamia, sacrifice is an offering of something that the gods need for their enjoyment if not for their survival, while at the same time sacrificial action gives man a mechanism of control over this channel of communication. Divine enjoyment is vividly described in myths such as that of Atramhasis, where man's creation is actually explained in terms of a service that must be permanently rendered to the gods. On the other hand, the use that man makes of it as a guarantee of access to the divine sphere is seen especially in the case of magic, which must be considered as a sacrificial act in two respects. First, he uses materials, however modest (an onion, a simple clay figurine) that are separated from the rest of the "worldly" sphere, that is, made sacred. And then this material cannot be recovered, an aspect that is more conspicuous in magic than in other rituals&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: God does not need sacrifice(s) (-)</b>: &#147;In the biblical world, instead, sacrifice is something that God requires but does not need; in other words, there is no divine use of the material of sacrifice. Nor, on the other hand, is there a human fruition, because it is instead a deprivation of something on the part of man&#148;.<br>
This idea is made even more evident by a comparison between some passages from the Mesopotamian <i>Dialogue of Pessimism</i> (cf. chapter 12, section 3) and other biblical sources:<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Restoration of order</b>: &#147;Human effort to restore order when broken is part of the intention to establish a relationship with the absolute. Here, too, there is a strong similarity between the Mesopotamian and biblical worlds at the level of external forms, while considerations of structure reveal profound differences&#148;.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE</b>: &#147;In Mesopotamia, restoration is accomplished through the application of precise rules and under the careful protection of the gods. Since sin is not conceived as a personal offense against the absolute, it is aimed at a reintegration into the static order of things as determined by fate, a new alignment of the individual with his own destiny from which he is temporarily led astray&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel</b>: &#147;From the biblical point of view, instead, restoration is offered by God as a gift which comes along with the forgiveness that is requested with a specific spiritual disposition. God is the dynamic foundation of the universal order, he is the absolute on which this order is founded, and it is as such that he has been offended personally and that, just as personally, he must accept the change of heart on the part of the sinner&#148;.</li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Contexts for rituals</b><a name="*12">*</a>: &#147;How do these general principles apply in practice? They are implemented at great moments of transition in an individual's life, and that is where we have to look.&#148;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The initial confirmation of order occurs at the <b>birth</b> of the individual. While we know of no particular ceremonies related to this event in Mesopotamia, biblical circumcision [see <i>infra</i>] is proposed as a form of consecration to God of the individual (male) at the beginning of his existence.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE: none (-)</b>: &#147;It is interesting to note that there are no known Mesopotamian rituals for the newborn, but only spells that aim to protect the mother during childbirth&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: circumcision (+)</b>: &#147;In the biblical world, instead, there is the ritual of circumcision, which initially took place at puberty and was then brought back to the moment of birth&#148;.</li>

<li><b>Sexual maturity</b> is like a second birth, which leads to the formation of human couples and the consequent formation of the family. </li>

</ul>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Ritualism and a degradation of the experience</b>: &#147;In principle, rituals can confirm and reassure the individual's consciousness of the absolute by proposing the sharing of modes of perception. [...] However, it happens regularly that, because of the repetitive nature of rituals, word and action can easily become an end in themselves, and thus obscure the spontaneous impulse intrinsic to the lived experience of the initial spiritual reality. It happens then that religion, as a cultural phenomenon, leads to a hypertrophy, and therefore to an atrophy, of the spiritual dimension. This is especially noticeable in the case of the individual rituals that we have considered in this chapter, even if, it should be noted, this does not mean that the ritual itself inhibits experience, neither in Mesopotamia nor in a biblical context. We can define the degradation of experience as ritualism. The absolute, then, is seen to reside exclusively in the ritual mechanism, instead of being the source of inspiration&#148;.</li>

<h3><b><a name="22">2.2 Chapter 22: <i>Worship</i></a></b><a name="*10">*</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Divinity &#8211; object or subject?</b>: &#147;The object/subject polarity, on which we have reflected in the previous chapter on proclamation, also emerges with regard to worship. The density of the liturgical activities which develop the choreographic dimension to the maximum, and the precise ritualization, which ensures the most scrupulous repetitiveness, is a clear indication of the human contribution to the formation of this complex. From this point of view, the divinity is clearly an object of worship&#148;.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE: object</b>: &#147;This fact stands out in the most explicit way in Mesopotamia, where the "service" (<i>dullu</i>)<a name="*1">*</a><a href="#Note*"><sup>Note</sup></a><a name="Back*"></a> of the gods is insistently highlighted as the essence of the human relationship to the divinity, to the point that this could be the term with which to translate our word "religion" into Akkadian. Mesopotamian worship is completely identified with this service: the gods are its beneficiaries, and they do not otherwise take part in it. I mentioned the possibility of interpreting divination as the cult of fate – and in this case the nature of the object is even more evident, because it is not even possible for fate to react in any way&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: subject</b>: &#147;Even in the biblical world the concept of divine "service" (<a href="https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/345-abodah" target="_blank">עֲבוֹדָה, <i>`&#259;bod&#257;(h)</i></a>) is important. But far from being the inert recipient of this service, God is perceived as an agent who transcends the role of object and responds actively. He is perceived, therefore, as an object that presents itself as a subject at the same time. It is a precise verification of the perception of God as "living": even the most accurate execution of ritual mechanisms is not in itself the purpose of worship, specifically because God is not an automatic target&#148;.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Sacrifice</b><a name="*2">*</a>: &#147;The nature of sacrifice reveals such a dichotomy&#148;.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE: need for (+)</b>: &#147;In Mesopotamia, it is an offering of something tangible that has value in itself. The value, intrinsic to the material of the offering, is affirmed by the very fact that the divinity needs it. Man contributes to the well-being of the divinity, and the function of the offering is entirely contained in the very act of achieving its goal &#8211; the divinity as an object&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: no need for (-)</b>: &#147;In the Bible, God does not need sacrifices because everything that could be offered to him he created in the first place (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=50&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Ps 50:9-13</a>) [cf. also <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a> <i>supra</i>] &#8211; yet another verification of the ethos of creation<a href="#*11">*</a>. Sacrifice has value not because it is valuable in itself, but because it reveals an inner attitude of one who offers it to someone, God, who is not at all the object of a transaction, but a subject who responds in unpredictable ways&#148;.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Priests = technicians of the cult</b><a name="*9">*</a>: &#147;The complexity of the practical and intellectual framework of this system requires a team of operators who in turn know how to follow the technique. They are the priests. But, to the extent that they are limited to the "craft" of the ritual, we can consider them more as technicians than as spokesmen for the basic spiritual afflatus. [...] [<b>BUT</b>] People involved in worship are more responsible for technique than for spirituality&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Sacralization</b><a name="*13">*</a>: &#147;The forms of control<a name="*15">*</a> take on a rather characteristic modality. It is not a question of changing the nature of the phenomenon, but of inserting it into the sphere of the absolute through procedures that make it sacred, once the patterns underlying the systematic nature of the phenomenon itself have already been ascertained and defined. [...] An important element of Mesopotamian worship is the sacralization of various aspects of culture&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Control of time</b><a name="*16">*</a>: &#147;The ability to recognize the cyclical nature of the seasons lies at the basis of the agricultural revolution. The connection between the seed and the plant is a phenomenon that in itself requires a great intellectual capacity, all the more so because it is linked to a further connection, namely that of the moments in which the seed-plant relationship becomes operative in practice. [...] A fundamental result of these observations was the creation of the <b>calendar</b><a name="*17">*</a>&#148;.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE: the New Year fest (<a href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8381" target="_blank"><i>ak&#299;tu</i></a>)</b><a name="*18">*</a>: &#147;The fundamental event in this regard is the celebration of the New Year which celebrates the phenomenon of the beginning. The cycle is, yes, recurring, but with very precise terminal points. It is not a fluid cycle, but instead a cycle that ends and allows another to begin. [...] The great importance of this conceptual attitude can be seen in its being incorporated into what is the most important religious feast of Mesopotamia, the New Year, which takes its name from a religious space, the <i>ak&#299;tu</i>, with which it was intimately connected. Thus, not only the cycle is sacralized, but its governability: a clear beginning that follows an equally clear end.&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: the <i>ethos of creation</i></b><a name="*11">*</a>: &#147;Biblical perception depends in part, like Mesopotamian perception, on the identification of cyclical phenomena linked to agricultural life. But it is transformed in a very singular way, because what breaks the cycle is the connection with divine interventions that are unique in time, because they are perceived as historical, as events that took place only once, and that are not repeated except in cultural memory. The control is thus profoundly different: the absolute itself, that is, God, intervenes from outside of cycle and proclaims not a beginning which, however new, is ultimately cyclical, but instead a beginning which is in itself an absolute event [i.e., the creation]&#148;.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Space</b>: &#147;The religious dimension is expressed in the way in which it is perceived that the deities can visit the territory, iconically. This is done through solemn processions, during which the statues are physically taken out of their temples and carried along routes that connected several temples, thus touching various areas of the urban hinterland and interurban areas&#148;.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE: processions (+)</b>: &#147;Processions were certainly a function of the statues, but they were also a function of the population. We have seen how the interlocutors of the Mesopotamian temple did not benefit from a knowledge of the inside of the temples, and therefore of the statues that were kept there. Instead, they could visually encounter the statues when they were paraded outside the temples. In this way, it was not only the physical space that was placed under the control of the gods, but also the human space, i.e., the population living in the territory&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: no processions (-)</b> (but cf. <a href="#*21">*</a>): &#147;In the biblical perspective, apart from the icon of the ark of the covenant in archaic times, the total aniconicity of official worship meant that processions were impossible. Divine control over space is therefore totally based on the ethos of creation<a href="#*11">*</a>&#148;.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Death and Underworld</b>:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE: rituals (+)</b>: &#147;Death opens a perspective on an ideological space: the "country from which one does not return" (<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0045680" target="_blank">kur.nu.gi</a> in Sumerian, <i>m&#257;t l&#257; t&#226;rim</i> in Akkadian) [...]. The rituals are, yes, for the benefit of the dead person, and therefore of the individual (see above, 13.14), but the perception we see is through the eyes of the survivors, i.e., the community that is left to deal with death. [...] The Mesopotamian attitude towards the dead derives from these different alternatives. The idea of a funeral banquet (<i>kispu</i>, literally "the breaking" of food) is important, that is, a ritual of communion with the dead of their family, who, having obtained the burial in the right way, can participate. The dead thus remain linked to the dimension of the living, even if there is no reason to think that this makes their existence more joyful&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Israel: no rituals (-)</b>: &#147;The biblical notion of the afterlife is very similar to the Mesopotamian one, especially with regard to the type of burial (burial, without cremation or mummification), the nature and period of mourning, and also very similar to the concept of the afterlife as an indefinite and dull resting place (the <i>&#353;e'&#244;l</i>), to which one is assigned without seeming to ask the question of a substantial moral judgement (but see below). There are, however, three important differences:
<ol>
<li>The first is the absence of sacrifices and rituals for the dead after burial.</li>
<li>Apart from the case, however limited, of necromancy<a href="#Note3"><sup>Note 3</sup></a><a name="Back3"></a> (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=28&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">1 Sam 28,8-20</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=12&prq=8&psq=19&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Is 8,19</a>), there are no references to the spirits of the dead, neither benevolent nor malevolent.</li>
<li>Above all, one notes the lack of a description of the ideal of life protracted in time.</li>
</ol>
Then [in Israel], the modality [of dealing with the afterlife] is defined in the sense of a new creation that leads to an unexpected corporeal dimension of the dead, that is, the resurrection. [...] This development of the idea of the resurrection, so totally non-Mesopotamian, can be compared with another purely biblical development, namely Messianism&#148;.</li>

<h2><A name="ANE">3 Rituals in the Ancient Near East</a></h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A useful source for information about rituals and cultic activities in the ANE can be found in the following publication:<br>
<br>

<b>Michael P. Streck (ed. in chief),<br> 
<i>Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Arch&#228;ologie</i>,<br>
Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter; Vol. 11 [Prinz, Prinzessin - Samug].</b><br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I report here a brief summary with some excerpts from the lemma <i>Ritual</i> (pp. 421-438, by Walter Sallaberger and Volker Haas: "Rituals in Mesopotamia" and "Rituals in the Hittite culture")<a href="#Note4"><sup>Note 4</sup></a><a name="Back4"></a> [English translation from German by <a href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/authorship/depietri.htm" target="_blank">mDP</a>], highlightening some peculiarities in rituals and cultic system of the ANE:<br>
<br>

<b>A: "Rituals in Mesopotamia"</b><br>
<ol>
<li><b>General</b>: &#147;'Ritual' is the name given to a religious act that is fixed in its course and that is carried out on a specific occasion. A ritual therefore comprises all elements of religious events defined in regulations, such as clothing, posture, gestures, movements, speaking or singing prayers&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Sources</b>:</li>
<ol>
<li><b>General sources</b>: &#147;Ritual texts, if preserved, concern less the temple cult<a name="*4">*</a> than other rituals. In contrast to Hatti, where ritual texts take up about two thirds of the literature, relatively few ritual texts come from Mesopotamia [...]. Incantations and prayers often also describe ritual acts to be performed at the same time. Administrative texts on the issue of victim material are usually dated and note recipient and type of victim; the underlying ritual can be reconstructed from this information&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Myths and rituals</b>: &#147;The connection between myth and ritual can be well described in Mesopotamia for the <i>En&#363;ma eli&#353;</i> and the Babylonian New Year fest [<a href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8381" target="_blank"><i>ak&#299;tu</i></a>]<a href="#*18">*</a>, where all forms of this connection are documented. The myth <i>En&#363;ma eli&#353;</i> is recited on the 5th day; in the ritual, the exit to the <a href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8381" target="_blank"><i>ak&#299;tu</i></a> festival house and the triumphant return, the myth is dramatically brought to mind; the cult acts are etiologically justified in comments on the New Year festival by the <i>En&#363;ma eli&#353;</i>, and the usual ritual elements at main festivals such as the boat trip is exegetically interpreted as meaning that <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html" target="_blank">Marduk</a> climbs the procession boat (god's boat) as well as the defeated <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/tiamat/index.html" target="_blank">Tiamat</a>&#148;.</li>
</ol>
<li><b>Elements of ritual</b>: &#147;Rituals, whether performed as part of the temple cult or for a specific occasion, usually represent a complex sequence of individual ritual elements that can be described with the term 'rite'. Since rituals are based on repetition and recognizability, the same ritual elements can appear in different contexts&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Occasions</b>: &#147;Rituals are performed recurring on specific, calendar or life-specific events. They prove their effectiveness in forthcoming innovations (in the status of a person, in the cult), and they help to cope with misfortune and impending dangers. The practice of the cyclical cult-rituals divides time and orders the religiously determined world, for example by treating the gods according to rank and type (such as being cared for on an equal footing), interpreting the cycle of nature in a mythical-ritual way, etc. On the other hand, rituals allow the challenges of life to be directed in orderly, ritually determined paths&#148;.</li>
<li><b>Ritual texts</b>:</li> 
<ol>
<li><b>General</b>: &#147;Ritual texts record the sequence of the rituals by presenting the action in general or addressing a particular cult participant, usually the summoner (<i>&#257;&#353;ipu</i>), but also to the plaintiff (<i>kal&#251;</i>) or the king. Although individual ritual elements are binding, the ritual texts show that ritual sequences can be combined with one another [...]. Like other specialist texts, ritual texts use clear prose with specific technical terms and idioms; the sentences are simply structured. The incantations to be recited in the ritual (in the <i>&#257;&#353;ipu</i>) or lamentations (in the <i>kal&#251;</i>) are quoted after their headline. In the 1<sup>st</sup> millennium, these evocations are usually grouped together in collections ('series'), which are arranged either according to the theme or according to the ritual (like <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%2016_mDP.htm" target="_blank"><i>maql&#251;</i></a>). In the latter case, in addition to the detailed text of the entire incantations, a series also includes a so-called ritual table, which is either at the beginning or at the end of the table series and the sequence of the ritual with the lines of stitching of describes reciting texts [...]. Furthermore, at the end of incantations (such as <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/sources/appendix%2013_mDP.htm" target="_blank"><i>namburbi</i></a>) and prayers (such as <i>&#353;uilla</i>) there are often ritual instructions. The incantations themselves often provide information on the underlying ritual without being ritual texts themselves&#148;.</li>

<h2><A name="Israel">4 Worshipping God in ancient Israel</a></h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A useful source for information about rituals and cultic activities in ancient Israel can be found in the following handbook:<br>
<br>

<b><a href="http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Achtemeier1996Harper" target="_blank">Paul Achtemeier <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>,<br> 
<i>The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary</i>,<br> 
San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco.</b><br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I report here some excerpts from the lemma <i>Worship</i> (pp. 1222-1225)<a href="#Note7"><sup>Note 7</sup></a><a name="Back7"></a>:<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Worship</b><a href="#Note8"><sup>Note 8</sup></a><a name="Back8"></a>, the attitude and acts of reverence to a deity. The term "worship" in the OT translates the Hebrew word meaning "to bow down, prostrate oneself," a posture indicating reverence and homage given to a lord, whether human or divine. The concept of worship is expressed by the term "serve."<a href="#*1">*</a> In general, the worship given to God was modeled after the service given to human sovereigns; this was especially prominent in pagan religions. In these the deity's image inhabited a palace (temple) and had servants (priests) who supplied food (offered sacrifices)<a href="#*2">*</a>, washed and anointed and clothed it, scented the air with incenses, lit lamps at night, and guarded the doors to the house. Worshipers brought offerings and tithes to the deity, said prayers and bowed down, as one might bring tribute and present petitions to a king. Indeed the very purpose of human existence, in Mesopotamian thought, was to provide the gods with the necessities of life. Although Israelite worship shared many of these external forms, even to calling sacrifices "the food of God" (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=21&psq=6&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Lev. 21:6</a>), its essence was quite different. As the prophets pointed out, God could not be worshiped only externally. To truly honor God, it was necessary to obey his laws, the moral and ethical ones as well as ritual laws. To appear before God with sacrifices while flouting his demands for justice was to insult him (cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=12&prq=1&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Isa. 1:11-17</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=17&prq=5&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Amos 5:21-22</a>). God certainly did not need the sacrifices for food (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=50&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ps. 50:12-13</a>); rather sacrifice and other forms of worship were offered to honor God as king<a name="*3">*</a>.</li>

<li><b>Sacrifice</b><a href="#Note9"><sup>Note 9</sup></a><a name="Back9"></a>: Ideal Israelite worship is depicted in the Priestly instructions of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. Its most prominent feature is sacrifice<a href="#*2">*</a>. Sacrifices were brought as gifts to God; the Hebrew term for cereal offering also means "present" (cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=32&psq=19&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Gen. 32:19</a>, where Jacob offers a large present to Esau to win his favor) or "tribute"<a href="#Note10"><sup>Note 10</sup></a><a name="Back10"></a> (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=9&prq=8&psq=2&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">2 Sam. 8:2</a>). In addition, the blood of the sin and guilt offerings was used to cleanse the sanctuary. The most important part of any animal sacrifice  was the disposal of the blood at the altar. Whether dashed against its sides, or smeared on its horns, this ritual act made the sacrifice valid; in fact, it distinguished sacrifice from mere slaughter. [...] In exchange for his services, the priest received some portion of the sacrifice. Cattle, sheep, goats, doves, and pigeons were the only kinds of animals that could be offered, and vegetable offerings used wheat, barley, olive oil, wine, and frankincense. [...] Sacrificial animals had to be unblemished; that is, they could not be diseased or injured or castrated (see <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=22&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 22:17-25</a>). The burnt offering (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=1&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 1</a>) was the commonest and most general sacrifice. Appropriate for <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/Achtemeier1996Harper.htm#Atonement" target="_blank">atonement</a><a name="*8">*</a> or thanksgiving, its purpose, basically, was to win God's favor. It was probably the oldest kind of sacrifice (mentioned throughout the Bible) and played a major role in public worship (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&psq=29&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 28-29</a>) and rites of cleansing (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=12&psq=6&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 12:6</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=12&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">8</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=14&psq=9&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">14:19</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=14&psq=22&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">22</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=15&psq=15&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">15:15</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=15&psq=30&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">30</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=24&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">16:24</a>). The animal offered had to be male (except birds). The animal was entirely burned on the altar, except for the hide, which went to the priest (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=7&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 7:8</a>). [...] The term "sin offering" is somewhat misleading. The purpose of this sacrifice (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=4&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 4-5:13</a>) was not to atone for any kind of sin, as the name seems to imply. Crimes against other people were dealt with by appropriate punishments that did not involve sacrifice, while deliberate crimes against God (done "with a high hand"<a name="*23">*</a>) could not be sacrificially atoned for at all (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=15&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 15:30-31</a>). Rather, the sin offering was used to cleanse the sanctuary of impurity. For this reason it was regularly offered at festivals (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&psq=15&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 28:15</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&psq=22&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">22</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&psq=30&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">30</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=29&psq=5&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">29:5</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=29&psq=11&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">11</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=29&psq=16&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">16</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=29&psq=19&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">19</a>). [...] The guilt offering (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=5&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 5:14-6:7</a>) was brought when one had desecrated some holy thing (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=5&psq=14&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 5:14</a>) or perjured oneself (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=6&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 6:2-5</a>). Its purpose was the reparation of damages. [...] The cereal offering (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=2&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 2</a>) was a vegetable counterpart to the burnt offerings. It could be raw, in which case frankincense was added, or cooked in various ways (baked, boiled, fried), but it could not be leavened or sweetened (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=2&psq=11&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 2:11</a>). Oil was present whether the offering was cooked or raw.</li>

<li><b>Temple<a href="#*4">*</a> Ritual</b><a href="#Note11"><sup>Note 11</sup></a><a name="Back11"></a>: The daily ritual was as follows: every morning, the ashes on the sacrificial altar were cleared off and the fire was stoked (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=6&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 6:10-13</a>), and the daily burnt offering, a yearling male lamb, plus its accompanying cereal and drink offerings, was offered (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=6&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 6:8-13</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=29&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 29:38-42</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 28:3-8</a>). The high priest, dressed in his priestly garments (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=28&psq=29&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 28:29</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=28&psq=30&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">30</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=28&psq=35&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">35</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=28&psq=38&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">38</a>), entered the sanctuary, trimmed the oil lamps, and offered a specially formulated incense on the incense altar inside (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=30&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 30:7-9, 34-36</a>). Outside, he would offer a special cereal offering, composed of wheaten cakes cooked on a griddle (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=6&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 6:19-23</a>). In the evening, a second lamb was offered like the morning one, and the high priest again entered the sanctuary to trim the oil lamps (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=24&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 24:1-4</a>; cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=3&psq=3&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Sam. 3:3</a>) and burn incense. He would also offer the second half of the high-priestly cereal offering. Such was the daily routine. Every Sabbath day two additional lambs were offered, like the daily ones (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 28:9-10</a>). Also, the high priest would replace the twelve loaves of bread (the Bread of Presence), which were arranged in two rows on the table inside the sanctuary, with frankincense on top (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=24&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 24:5-9</a>; cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=21&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Sam. 21:1-6</a>). At the beginning of each month (the new moon) and at all the festivals the priests blew trumpets (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=10&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 10:8</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=10&psq=10&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">10</a>) and additional sacrifices were offered, both burnt offerings and a sin offering (which was always a male goat; see <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=28&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 28-29</a>). Festival days (or the beginning and end of week-long festivals) were days of rest, like the Sabbath (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 23:7-8</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&psq=21&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">21</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&psq=24&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">24</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&psq=27&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">27</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&psq=35&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">35</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&psq=36&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">36</a>). On the <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/Achtemeier1996Harper.htm#Atonement" target="_blank">Day of Atonement</a> the people rested and fasted, and the high priest, wearing special garments for the occasion, performed the <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/Achtemeier1996Harper.htm#Atonement" target="_blank">Day of Atonement</a> ritual (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 16</a>), which cleansed the sanctuary of all impurity. It consisted of two sin offerings, one for the high priest and one for the people, whose blood was brought not only into the sanctuary but into the inner shrine itself, the Holy of Holies, where the Ark of God was kept. The high priest entered the Holy of Holies only after placing a pan of burning incense inside, to make a screen of smoke between him and the Ark (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=13&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 16:13</a>). After cleansing the sanctuary, the priest laid his hands on a living goat and confessed the people's sins, thereby transferring those sins to the goat, which was then sent away into the wilderness.</li>

<li><b>Donations</b>: In addition to these public and private sacrifices, offered at regular seasons or at will, the people donated a tenth portion of their produce to the sanctuary. This tithe was given to the Levites, in exchange for their work in guarding and transporting the tabernacle (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=18&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 18:21-24</a>). The Levites themselves gave a tithe of their tithe to the priests (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=18&psq=26&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 18:26</a>). Furthermore, the priests received the first fruits<a href="#*5">*</a> of all produce, including a sheaf of grain at the beginning of the harvest and two loaves of leavened bread at its end (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=23&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 23:10-11, 17</a>; cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=18&psq=11&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 18:11</a>), the firstborn of all livestock (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=18&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 18:12-13, 15-17</a>), and the first part of the processed produce (flour, wine, oil; cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=15&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 15:17-21</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=18&psq=12&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">18:12</a>). People might also voluntarily donate items to the sanctuary, which would then belong to the priests. If persons or nonsacrificial animals were donated, only the monetary value was paid (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=27&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 27:1-8</a>).</li>

<li><b>Ritual Purity</b></b><a href="#Note12"><sup>Note 12</sup></a><a name="Back12"></a>: Persons participating in worship had to be ritually clean<a href="#*6">*</a>. Contact with a corpse (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=19&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 19</a>) or animal carcasses (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=11&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 11:8</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=11&psq=24&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">24-25</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=11&psq=31&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">31</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=11&psq=39&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">39</a>), sexual emissions (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=15&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 15</a>), giving birth to a child (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=12&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 12</a>), and leprosy (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=13&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 13</a>) all caused a person to become unclean in various degrees. An unclean person could not eat sacrificial meat (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=7&psq=20&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 7:20</a>), enter the sanctuary, or even handle tithes or other items belonging to God (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=4&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 12:4</a>). Cleansing was effected by bathing and washing one's clothes. Certain more severe states of impurity required additional rites of cleansing and might take several days to complete. Although one was excluded from worship, being unclean was not a crime. Failure to cleanse oneself after the period of impurity had passed, however, was sinful and necessitated bringing a sin offering (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=5&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 5:2-3</a>), since (prolonged) impurity defiled the sanctuary (cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=19&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 16:19</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=19&psq=20&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 19:20</a>). To be eligible to officiate in the sanctuary, priests were required not only to be clean but unblemished (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=21&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 21:17-23</a>). Furthermore, they could not officiate while drunk (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=10&psq=9&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 10:9</a>) or mourning (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=10&psq=6&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 10:6</a>). They had to be properly dressed (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=28&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 28:40-43</a>); and before officiating at either the altar or inside the sanctuary they were to wash their hands and feet (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=30&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 30:18-21</a>; priests did not wear shoes: cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=3&psq=5&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 3:5</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=6&prq=5&psq=15&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Josh. 5:15</a>).</li>

<li><b>Other Versions of Ritual Procedures</b>: The book of Deuteronomy presents a slightly modified (though much less detailed) version of the system described by the Priestly texts<a href="#Note13"><sup>Note 13</sup></a><a name="Back13"></a>. The principal difference lies in Deuteronomy's insistence on a single sanctuary for the entire land of Israel to which all sacrifices were to be brought (cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=12&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 12:5-14</a>). As a result, Deuteronomy permitted profane slaughter of animals for meat (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=12&psq=15&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 12:15</a> vs. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=17&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 17:2-4</a>), since for many Israelites the distance to the sanctuary was too great (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=12&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 12:20-21</a>). There were also other, relatively minor differences in detail in Deuteronomy, regarding the Passover (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=16&psq=2&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 16:2</a> vs. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=12&psq=5&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 12:5</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=16&psq=7&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 16:7</a> vs. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=12&psq=9&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod. 12:9</a>), tithes (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=14&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 14:22-29</a> vs. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=18&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num. 18</a>), and the priests' share of sacrifices (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=18&psq=2&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut. 18:2</a> vs. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=7&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev. 7:31-32</a>). Worship in Ezekiel's visionary temple (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=14&prq=40&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ezek. 40-48</a>) also differs somewhat from the Priestly system. For instance, Ezekiel calls for a purification of the temple on the first and seventh days of the first month, presumably in preparation for the Passover (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=14&prq=45&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ezek. 45:18-20</a>; cf. v. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=14&prq=45&psq=21&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">21</a>). He also mentions only a single daily burnt offering sacrificed each morning (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=14&prq=46&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ezek. 46:13-15</a>). Ezekiel's system was never actually put into effect, but it may reflect the thinking of certain priests of his time, since Ezekiel himself was a priest (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=14&prq=1&psq=3&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ezek. 1:3</a>).</li>

First of all, some <b>methodological considerations</b> are here pinpointed (from Chapter 8. <i>Rituals and Ritual Theory: A Methodological Essay</i> [by Ithamar Gruenwald]; remarkable key-words are <b>bolded</b>)

<ul>
<li><b>What is a ritual?</b>: &#147;In the eyes of many, rituals constitute a <b>riddle</b>. Many people do not understand what makes rituals work and how the doing of rituals is essential to reaching specific goals. In other words, what are rituals and what do they do? Social ethnography, anthropology, and the comparative study of religions consider rituals as the <b>dynamic core</b> of social and religious systems. From tribal groups to fully developed religious systems, rituals play a major role in making the respective systems work. However, rituals are also vital for the orderly functioning of bureaucratic organizations and structures. Whether these rituals are agreed upon or prescribed by an <b>accepted authority</b>, they are a major factor in bringing people together in a working <b>coherence</b>. In other words, rituals create and maintain social systems&#148; (p. 109).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Nature of rituals</b>: &#147;Rituals consist of <b>stylized</b> ceremonial events. They evolve in strict and <b>repetitive protocols</b>. Among them one finds rich displays of colors (e.g., garments [uniforms], insignia, flags), instrumental and vocal music, and a variety of physical gestures (e.g., parades, stylized exercises). One may view these protocols as the <b>bureaucracy of rituals</b>, each of them consisting of a purposive "cosmos"&#148; (p. 109).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Function of rituals</b>: &#147;A starting point in assessing rituals and figuring out a relevant ritual theory is the notion that rituals constitute a major component in <b>human behavior</b>, in general. In other words, many forms of human activity unfold as structured forms of behavior that come into purposive effect by doing an orderly sequence of purposefully detailed acts. The bureaucracy of ritual protocols constitutes <b>structured segments</b> that obey an inner logic of functional organization. Together these segments compose the processual dynamic that unfolds as a ritually configured whole&#148; (p. 109).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Analysis of rituals</b>: &#147;It follows, then, that the discussion of rituals and ritual theory is best undertaken in the context of <b>behavioral factors</b>. That is, rituals are best discussed in terms of what is done, how it is done, and what existential and <b>anthropological functions</b> the actions are expected to accomplish. In our view, the ideological and theological concerns that accompany rituals do not account for the performance aspects of rituals. In disciplinary terms, anthropology with an eye on socio-psychological issues (mainly group and identity formation) is the adequate platform for the study and scholarly assessment of rituals&#148; (pp. 109-110).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Analysis: methodology (two ways)</b>: &#147;The study of rituals can be done in two complementary ways: by <b>observing</b> live rituals or by <b>studying</b> texts that contain ritual prescriptions and guidelines. In both cases, not all the needed details of what is done and how become clear&#148; (p. 110).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Behavioral view</b>: &#147;Viewed from a <b>behavioral angle</b>, rituals are extensions of the human mind. They reflect a specific inclination on the part of the <b>group</b> or the <b>individual</b> to express themselves in structured and purposive forms of behavior, rather than, or instead of, ideas. Evidently, religious rituals engage unique spectra and complex layers of such behavior&#148; (p. 110).<br>
<small>[Note how here the dichotomy "individual vs. group" recalls G. Buccellati's distinction between and "individual vs. a communal level" (Chapters 13 and 22 respectively)<a href="#*ToC">*</a>.]</small></li>
<br>
<li><b>Myths and rituals</b>: &#147;In many cases, rituals are sustained by a link to a story in a <b>mythic context</b>. In other words, myth is a story that links and sustains a ritual. In the mythic context, rituals make a culture-related point. They are shared by a concerned and involved community, creating complex notions of social identity and cohesion&#148; (p. 110).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Function of rituals in the community</b>: &#147;Religious rituals, though, are by definition shared by a <b>community</b>. More than any other ritual, religious rituals create group cohesion. In their special context, religious rituals are reinforced with theological stances. Apart from their function in establishing social identity, rituals create notions of (bureaucratic) <b>hierarchy and social stratification</b>. At the same time, rituals are functional in maintaining social diversity and ideological differences, even factors of alienation, which enhance the existence of classes, groups, and denominations&#148; (p. 111).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Brief synthesis</b>: &#147;To sum up this part, the ritual aspects of human behavior come into effect in segmented units that link together to make a workable whole, a <b>ritual Gestalt</b>. Furthermore, the enactment of rituals assumes that repeating the same things in the right order guaranteesthe same results. The <b>repetitive factor</b> is a dominant feature. The same things are done in the same manner to achieve or fulfil the same aims or results. In other words, rituals presuppose a strictly observed <b>protocol</b>. [...] any change in the processual protocol is likely to disrupt the ritual process and end in failure. Culturally oriented rituals engage a wide spectrum of factors. They bring about what may be considered substantial changes in life-preserving or life-enhancing processes. They empower processes that prevent the disruption or annihilation of existence in the broad sense of that term. In other words, rituals bring into effect dynamic processes vital for creating and sustaining processes that sustain the existence of a "cosmos." Or, else, <b>they prevent the termination, disintegration, or annihilation of that "cosmos"</b>&#148; (p. 111).</li>
<br>
<li><b>"Four-steps" structure of ritual (segmentation)</b>: &#147;In principle, rituals engage four experiential platforms: the <b>reality</b> that requires change or was damaged and needs to be fixed (the starting point); what makes the change happen (the <b>ritual act</b>); what is expected to happen (<b>the effect</b> that rituals have on shaping requested realities) or what comes into functional existence; and, finally, the likely <b>results or consequences</b> of the ritual act (what the new reality facilitates or brings about). Every ritual embodies a "cosmos" of its own, with its own rules and forms of functioning. Furthermore, every "cosmos" embeds or is likely to create its modes of sharing with other rituals, thus building a totality, a "ritual cosmology," which is the overarching ritual system of any religious system or social structure. As indicated, each ritual consists of a set of entities, sections, or segments&#148; (p. 114).</li>
</ul>
<br>

Hereafter, some considerations on some <b>aspects concerning Giorgio Buccellati's volume</b> are presented, and <b>structural comparisons</b> are advanced, quoting passages from the aformentioned book:<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Meaning of rituals</b><a href="#*7">*</a>: &#147;The construction of rites and rituals enables humans to conceive and apprehend this transcendent order, to symbolize it and interact with it, to postulate its truths in the face of contradicting realities and to repair them when they have been breached or diminished&#148; (Balentine, p. 1).</li>
<br>

<li><b>"Scapegoat" rituals in Hittite culture</b><a href="#*7">*</a>: &#147;<i>Substitute or "Scapegoat" Rituals</i>. These procedures do not belong in the category of offerings, because their purpose was not the bestowal of a gift on a deity, but rather the disposal of impurity, sin, blood-guilt, or other unwanted quality. Nonetheless, they must be mentioned here because in many cases they were performed not for an individual, but on behalf of a societal collectivity, such as the Hittite army. Their goal was accomplished through the transferal of the moral or literal pollution (<i>papratar</i>) from the patient onto a living carrier, who was then either driven off into the wilderness or killed. In the latter instance the victim, along with the associated evil, was indeed definitively removed from the human realm, but this practice is really a magical one. The few attestations of "human sacrifice" in Hittite texts are to be interpreted in this manner&#148; (Beckman, p. 46).</li>
<br>

<li><b>Relationships between Israel and Canaanite rituals</b><a name="*19">*</a>: &#147;<i>Perceived Importance for Biblical Study</i>. Perhaps the most important reason the discoveries from Ugarit were seized upon as of relevance for the study of the Bible was the early surmise that this was a Canaanite city. Previously the principal source of knowledge of the Canaanites was the Hebrew Bible, where they were hardly presented in a good light. Perhaps here was a direct witness to Canaanite culture and, in the texts, beliefs. But reasons for the initial interest went beyond the suggestion that Ugarit was a Canaanite city, and that its texts would provide a direct witness to Canaanite religion and culture. That there had been an Israelite conquest of, and
settlement in, Canaan was also widely believed, and much of the debate revolved around whether the Exodus took place in the 15th or 13th century BCE rather than whether it happened at all. So here was potential evidence of the Canaanites from a time close to when Israelites may have been encountering Canaanites&#148; (Curtis, p. 54).<br> 
<small>[cf. <i>infra</i> the section on <a href="#Ebla">Cultic Rituals at Ebla/Tell Mardikh</a>, where also a comparison to Ugaritic texts is presented.]</small></li>
<br>

<li><b>Atonement in Syria</b><a href="#*8">*</a>: &#147;<i>An Atonement Ritual?</i>. Noteworthy is what Wyatt entitles <i>A Liturgy for a Rite of Atonement for the People of Ugarit</i>. Several copies of this ritual have survived, the most complete being <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q86680695" target="_blank">KTU 1.40</a>. Del Olmo Lete speaks of "Rites of Purification and Atonement," but Pardee entitles it a "Ritual for National Unity." The crucial word <i>npy</i> has been variously understood. Pardee gives "well-being," and Wyatt picks up on his explanation of the underlying meaning as "being made whole," suggesting that the obvious technical equivalent in English is "atonement." If this understanding of the text is correct, it provides a possible parallel to the idea of an annual Day of Atonement in the Hebrew Bible (see <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Leviticus 16</a>)&#148; (Curtis, p. 65).</li>
<li><b>Palace rituals in Syria</b>: &#147;<i>Palace Rituals: Funerary and Non-funerary</i>.  Wyatt refers to text KTU 1.161 as "A Royal Funeral Liturgy" and, noting that it involves the summoning up of <i>rpum</i> (corresponding to the <i>r&#277;p&#257;’&#238;m</i> of the Hebrew Bible), suggests that it "provides a remarkable backdrop to <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=12&prq=14&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Isa. 14.9-21</a>"&#148; (Curtis, p. 66).</li>
<br>

<li><b>Priests</b><a href="#*9">*</a>: &#147;<i>Cultic Personnel and Religious Specialists</i>. Almost all religions appear to have cult personnel of some sort. They might be priests with a formal office and formal duties or they might be senior figures of the religious community who lead in worship on a part-time basis. The ancient Roman religion did not have priests as such, but the head of the family normally undertook cultic duties. Ancient Israel may not originally have had a hereditary priesthood, since we have accounts of a variety of figures who took on cultic duties (Jonathan [<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=7&prq=17&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Judges 17-18</a>]; Samuel [<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=1&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">1 Samuel 1-3</a>]; David's sons [<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=8&psq=18&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">1 Sam 8:18</a>]). But at some point a hereditary priesthood was appointed, with various ranks that exercised a variety of specialized duties. These included the Aaronites and the Levites, but also a number of other classes of temple servant with other (sometimes more menial) duties (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=36&prq=2&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ezra 2:41-58</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=37&prq=7&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Neh 7:44-60</a>). Priests were not the highest rank of cult specialist, however. A number of passages make it clear that the king was in charge of the temple and all personnel who served there (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=10&prq=4&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Kgs 4:2-5</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=10&prq=6&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">6-8</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=38&prq=22&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Chron 22:1–23:6</a>), even if attempts were made to edit the text in such a way that the king was subject to the priests (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=17&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut 17:14–20</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=39&prq=26&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">2 Chron 26:16–21</a>). The temple was the king's chapel, and at various times he led the religious ceremonies (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=10&prq=3&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Kgs 3:4–15</a>). It is hardly surprising since, as in many neighboring nations, the king was considered the son of God and had a special religious place in the national order (cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=2&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Psalm 2</a>)&#148; (Grabbe, p. 103).</li>
<br>

<li><b>Worship ritual</b><a href="#*10">*</a>: &#147;<i>Worship Ritual (Sacrificial System)</i>. The cult is often slighted or even ignored when Israel's religion is discussed, because it revolves around animal sacrifice. Any description of Israelite religion has to take stock of its complexities, but one cannot get away from the fact that the sacrificial cult, especially blood sacrifice, lay at the heart of worship in Israel. The various aspects of the temple cult are too lengthy to describe in detail here, so only two aspects will be commented on in this section. The Israelite cult, like all religious ritual &#8211; and all religions have their ritual &#8211; was extremely meaningful to the participants even if we do not always understand it from our time and culture millennia later. A number of recent studies have focused on the symbolism of the cult and attempted to decipher the priestly world view that lay behind it. For example, F. H. Gorman argues that a complex <b>creation theology</b> is presupposed and represented by the cult. The priestly view had a cosmological and sociological dimension, as well as a cultic. In order to express this, it made distinctions between holy and profane, clean and unclean, life and death, order and chaos. The lengthy ritual described in <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=8&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Leviticus 8–9</a> has many characteristics of what is often referred to as a "rite of passage". This is an anthropological term for rites that take place as a person passes from stage to another, such as from boyhood to manhood or girlhood to womanhood. There is first a rite of separation, next a transitional rite during which the person is in a "liminal" state (on the doorstep between one phase and another). There may be dangers while in this liminal state, and various rituals have to be carefully performed to protect the one undergoing the transition. In the case of Aaron and sons, they were undergoing the passage from "common" to "sacred." Thus, the ceremony of consecration in <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=8&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Leviticus 8–9</a> is very much parallel with rites of passage known both from preliterate modern societies and from many examples in modern Western culture&#148; (Grabbe, p. 104).<br>
<small>[This passage is very interesting since many topics presented by Giorgio Buccellati are here recalled: the <i>ethos od creation</i><a href="#*11">*</a>, the concept of "rite of passage"<a href="#*12">*</a>, and that of "sacralization"<a href="#*13">*</a>.<a href="#Note14"><sup>Note 14</sup></a><a name="Back14a"></a>]</small></li>
<br>
<li><b>Anthropology of rituals</b>: &#147;The predominant anthropological understanding of ritual as symbolic communication &#8211; which has been referred to as "canonical" and "almost a social compact in anthropology" &#8211; can be termed "representational"; that is, <b>ritual actions stand representatively for various phenomena</b> (most quite abstract): social relations, beliefs, values, concepts, or worldview. [...] this understanding of ritual as symbolic activity goes back to the first definitions of ritual that were formulated as anthropology emerged as a distinctive scholarly discipline. It is expressed by key figures in the development of the discipline, [...] referring to ritual actions ("rites") as "the regulated symbolic expressions of certain sentiments". While the identification of ritual as symbolic activity has a long history in anthropology, it took on a new life with the emergence of what came to be termed "symbolic anthropology" (especially in American contexts)&#148; (Gilders, p. 128).</li>
<br>

<li><b>Comparative approach (ANE, Israel and Greece)</b>: &#147;This chapter summarizes basic characteristics of the encounter with the divine in the cultures of the ancient Near East (ANE), ancient Greece, and Israel. It focuses on essential elements of the relations between humans and their gods in order to understand especially the Biblical God YHWH as a participant in ritual and cultic practices. To achieve this, the essay thoroughly considers an <b>emic</b> (cultural or contextual) as well as an <b>etic</b><a href="#Note15"><sup>Note 15</sup></a><a name="Back15"></a> (modernscholarly) point of view. For that it is necessary, on the one hand, to put the material evidence from archaeology into perspective. On the other hand, the most important sources for a differentiated overview on the matter are textual traditions from the ancient world. The chapter starts by posing a question whose answer normally seems self-evident: "What is a god?" The comparison between different ancient cultures leads to a working definition of gods/God and serves as a foil to outline basic characteristics of YHWH. A further survey is dedicated to central topics of the communication between gods and humans by focusing on the complex of offerings/sacrifice&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 145).</li>
<ul>
<li><b>G/god(s)</b>:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Mesopotamia</b>: &#147;A collection of essays by prominent Assyriologists provides a valuable definition of the supernatural beings called "gods" in ancient cuneiform sources; the philological and archaeological contributions show some important commonalities: in the religions of ancient Mesopotamia gods are predominantly <b>personalized entities</b> with anthropomorphic shape and behavior. Together they mark the center of a divine sphere that is linguistically identified by the determinative <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025832" target="_blank">DINGIR</a>, "god/divine" (a Sumerian word; in Akkadian the term for god is <i>ilu</i>, as in other Semitic languages). This sign of the cuneiform script not coincidentally represents a star, a heavenly body evoking notions of splendor, movement, order, and inaccessible height/superiority. What do material objects (e.g., certain weapons or the kettle drum) and more abstract concepts (e.g., justice and righteousness) have in common so that they have all been written with the determinative for "god"? From a modern point of view neither inanimate things nor abstract concepts seems to be plausible candidates for a divine personification&#148; (Hartenstein, pp. 145-146).</li>
<li><b>Egypt</b> <small>[passage not reported here: see Hartenstein, pp. 146-147.]</small>.</li>
<li><b>Syria (Ugarit)</b>: &#147;In Ugarit, the Bronze age north Syrian city, the gods were characterized by their superior powers and size, their immortality, and their separation from the realm of humankind as "sacred beings." The social life of the gods was easily "readable" since the norms of behavior followed the same <b>pattern of court and family structures</b> as in the city state. The <b>family metaphor</b> is basic to understand how and why the polytheistic world of gods in Ugarit also contained an implicit notion of unity: "the divine family was for polytheism a sort of monotheism". From another perspective the bi- and trilingual lists of gods from Ugarit may be understood as the expression of a holistic world view in which all the gods are minor parts of a greater sphere of the divine. It is also important to note the quite distinct divine personalities we find especially in the Ugaritic narratives (myths, epics and legends). Comparable to the early Greek religion, one has to be careful about gaining actual insights into common beliefs and practices of the Ugaritic religion due to the variety of sources (the textual genres like narratives, rituals or lists show significantly different aspects of the deities)&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 147).</li>
<li><b>Hittite</b>: &#147;The religion of the cultures in Asia Minor during the Bronze age shows certain Mesopotamian influences but maintains a specific <b>local and autochtonous character</b>, which is especially true for the substratum of the <b>Hurrian culture</b>. In the Hittite language, the semantic field for "purity" (<a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/chdS4.pdf#page=154" target="_blank"><i>suppi-</i></a>) corresponds with the status designated by the determinative <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025832" target="_blank">DINGIR</a> (the star-shaped Sumerogram inherited from Akkadian), which is connected with many material or immaterial objects or entities. It stands for the Hittite root <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/chds.pdf#page=505" target="_blank"><i>siu(n)-</i></a> "god/divine." The class of divine things encompasses, for example, all the deities, their symbols, and any other temple equipment. An abstractum <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/chds.pdf#page=551" target="_blank"><i>siunatar</i></a> means "divine/image of a god." In the Hittite religion many phenomena of nature and culture are <b>personified or deified</b>, for example, the hearth, smoke, the growth of plants, the door, the threshold, the night, or springs and mountains (which are often themselves conceptualized as minor or major goddesses and gods). The names for some of the aforementioned objects are often composed with a morpheme <i>-sepa/-nzipa</i> denoting a "supernatural" character&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 147).</li>
<li><b>Greece</b> <small>[passage not reported here: see Hartenstein, p. 148.]</small>.</li>
<li><b>Phoenicia</b>: &#147;In the religious universe of the Phoenicians, the <b>anthropomorphic shape</b> and the personal approachability of the gods were in the foreground. The concept of a human-like body, the proper names, and especially the "face" of the gods, made them accessible. The gods "hear," "bless," and bestow victories (to the rulers). A system of family relations and of hierarchy structures the divine sphere, which was ruled by a "mighty lord" (<i>‘dn</i> [...]). Sometimes the human part of the relation to the gods was conceptualized as a kind of treaty. The god was encountered in a courtly fashion in the temple cult like an earthly ruler. Iconic images as well as &#8211; prominent in Phoenicia &#8211; <b>aniconic symbols</b> (e.g. the <i>betyl</i>, an erected stone stela) were media of the divine presence that were usually considered to be of equal rank. The objects and entities considered to be part of the divine sphere included personified abstracta like "luck" (<i>gd</i>) or "justice" (<i>&#7779;dq</i>; cf. <i>&#7779;edeq</i> in the Old Testament). These were of no minor importance alongside the anthropomorphic gods and their sometimes <b>extra personified body-parts</b> like the "face"&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 148).</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Temple Service</b>:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Mesopotamia</b>: &#147;The "care and feeding of the gods" in the daily cult in Babylonian temples was aligned in all
respects with the idea of a "service"<a href="#*1">*</a> (<a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Oppenheim1964Mesopotamia" target="_blank">Oppenheim 1964</a>). The ritual took place without public access in analogy to the courtly ceremonies dedicated to the ruler. The basic equipment of a temple in this respect was aimed at the supply of food to the god and his entourage. For this a table and different storage vessels as well as one or more kitchens were necessary for the preparation of the meals. In later temples this was extended by a reception hall, which marked the parallel between the gods and the ruler even more clearly by setting up there a throne, attributes, and weapons. In addition, many temples had dormitories for the divine rulers, stables (for chariots and horses), and a quay for the god's journeys by boat to his fellow deities in other sanctuaries&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 152).</li>
<li><b>Egypt</b> <small>[passage not reported here: see Hartenstein, pp. 152-153.]</small>.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Sacrifice</b><a href="#*2">*</a>:</li> 
<ul>
<li><b>Mesopotamia</b>: 
&#147;For Mesopotamia and the Hittites no mythical transposition of the daily temple ritual [...] is known. But in all [...] cultures the regular cult in front of the images aimed at the maintenance of the communication between humans and deities. In this respect, the daily food ritual was only a part of the far more complex cultic symbolism and practice of the temples. Since ritual order often represents and confirms social order, the following rule for analyzing sacrifices might be useful: the communicative significance of a sacrifice can only be understood against the background of the ritual as a whole. The linguistic elements of the actions (prayers, invocations, declarations) play the decisive role in the modern as well as presumably in the ancient understanding of what was going on in the cultic actions&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 153).</li>
<li><b>Israel</b>: &#147;In research on the Israelite temple cult and its system of sacrifices—as mirrored in the book of Leviticus shaped by late Priestly redactors—categories of cultural anthropology have proven their value. The logic of sacrifice as a "gift" provides a possible clue for interpreting sacrifice in ancient Israel. We might also understand Israelite sacrifice with reference specifically to the symbolism of feasts and "hospitality"&#148; (Hartenstein, p. 154).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<br>
<li><b>The Temple</b>: &#147;In a dangerous world, where disease, childbirth<a href="#*14">*</a>, or lack of rainfall could prove fatal, people in the ANE turned to the gods to gain some measure of control<a href="#*15">*</a> over their lives. They believed that the gods governed the necessary, dangerous, and humanly uncontrollable elements of the world. In turn, they sought to secure divine favor to ensure some measure of security. How could they influence the gods without consistent access? Temples weretheir primary solution, <b>concretizing the divine presence</b> and enabling access to it. Rather than being the gathering place for a worshipping congregation, temples were considered divine homes to which common people had little access. In fact, the various ANE languages use the same language for a domestic dwelling and a temple (Ugaritic and Aramaic <i>bt</i>, Hebrew and Aramaic <i>byt</i>, Akkadian <i>b&#299;tu</i>, Sumerian <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0026529" target="_blank"><i>&#233;</i></a>, Hittite <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/CHDP.pdf#page=305" target="_blank"><i>per-</i> and <i>parn-</i></a>, and Egyptian <a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/GetWcnDetails?u=guest&f=0&l=0&wn=99790&db=0" target="_blank"><i>&#7717;wt</i></a> and <a href="https://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/GetWcnDetails?u=guest&f=0&l=0&wn=60220&db=0" target="_blank"><i>pr</i></a>)<a href="#Note16"><sup>Note 16</sup></a><a name="Back16"></a>. As such, they bear a greater resemblance to a modern home than a modern church. The temple's goal was not primarily to meet worshippers' needs, but divine ones, so that the resident deity would remain resident and continually extend its blessing and protection. The people presumed that as long as the deity in its temple was satisfied, the world around it would prosper&#148; (Hundley, p. 163).</li>

<li><b>Ritual experts</b><a href="#*9">*</a>: &#147;The ancient Near East offers a wide variety of ritual personnel due to regionally differing  systems of polytheism. As a rule, the priest or the priestess is the main ritual expert: He or she acts as mediator between the Divine (gods and goddesses) and human society or the individual, performs the rituals in the cult, and cares for the gods and goddesses. Other officiants, priests and non-priests, take over various tasks within the cult or in support of the activities at the temples. Often the king does not officiate in the cult, but he has the main responsibility to keep up the sanctuaries, their personnel, and the cult. As the priests and other ritual experts perform functions and tasks for the community, they get their alimentation by the state (the king). In many cases they are separated from the common to preserve their ritual purity and the dignity of their office&#148; (Hieke, p. 179).</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Mesopotamia</b>: &#147;Over three millennia the ancient Near Eastern religious culture developed in various regions quite differently. The Assyrian king for example, is the representative of the god Ashur on earth and officiates as the high priest of the god Ashur. In Babylonia, on the contrary, the king has to respect the position of the high priest, who ritually humiliates the king during the New Year Festival<a href="#*18">*</a> in order to remind him that he is a humble servant of the gods. However, some basic aspects appear in Mesopotamia as well as in other areas in more or less the same way. Priests and priestesses are members of the elite or upper class; they derive their origin from a priestly family of old or from the house of the king. Even at smaller sanctuaries, the office of the chief administrator of a temple (Sumerian, <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037304" target="_blank">SANGA</a>, Akkadian, <i>&#353;ang&#251;</i>) is handed down in one family over generations. As part of their office the priests cultivate a certain amount of specific knowledge and traditions&#148; (Hieke, pp. 179-180).</li>
<li><b>Mari (Euphrates)</b>: &#147;The Mari archive of cuneiform tablets does not stem from a temple, but from the royal palace, mostly from the time of king Zimri-Lim (18th century BCE). We have relatively good information about the administration and economy of the sanctuaries, but the evidence about cult and temple personnel is scarce. The most common male officiant is the <i>&#353;ang&#251;m</i> (Sumerian, <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037304" target="_blank">SANGA</a>, see previous subsection), who is the primary authority in a  temple. There were also priestesses of a high rank (<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0036237" target="_blank">nin</a>-<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025832" target="_blank">dingir</a>[-ra]<a href="#Note17"><sup>Note 17</sup></a><a name="Back17"></a>). Although described with similar terminology, the Mari temple personnel cannot be directly equated with the Babylonian ones; the Syrian temples may have represented much smaller communities than their Babylonian counterparts&#148; (Hieke, p. 181).</li>
<li><b>Hittite Anatolia</b>: &#147;Most of the basic aspects mentioned earlier also apply for Hittite Anatolia. The cult is organized by the state (the king). The "Instructions for Temple Personnel" (<a href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/hetkonk/hetkonk_abfrage.php?c=264" target="_blank">CTH 264</a>) offers insights into everyday situations of the priests; however, there is no proof that the office was hereditary. The priests have to carry out the cult in accordance with the prescriptions, with respect towards the gods, and in loyalty with the king. Ritual purity is important; after sexual intercourse, the priest must perform purifying rituals before officiating. The king plays an eminent role within the cult, functions as the highest priest, and takes part in almost all ritual feasts in Hatti&#148; (Hieke, p. 181).</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Priests</b>: &#147;The Hebrew term for "priest," <i>koh&#275;n</i> (plural: <i>kohan&#238;m</i>), occurs 750 times in the Hebrew Bible (and eight times in the Aramaic parts of Ezra). Its etymology is uncertain. [...]. Only males are "priests," the term is never applied to females. "Priest" is a multifaceted term with a variety of meanings and concepts in various religions past and present. Hence one has to unfold the specific concept of "priests" within the Hebrew Bible, which also differs from the current usage of the term in Christianity and Judaism. [... The priests] are introduced into their task in a special ordination ritual (see <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=8&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Leviticus 8–9</a>): In a <i>rite de passage</i>, the male member of the priestly family leaves the realm of ordinary life and passes over to the service at the sanctuary. Inside the sanctuary, the priests perform two major tasks. First, they serve at the altar. [...] In a second rite, the High Priest confesses over the head of a living goat, which is sent into the wilderness (the scapegoat<a href="#*7">*</a>: <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=21&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Lev 16:21</a>). [...] A third task of the priests, differing significantly from the major tasks described earlier, is the blessing of the people (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=6&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 6:22-27</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=10&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut 10:8</a>). [...] The role of the priests can be summarized withthe terms <b>"mediator"</b> and <b>"representative."</b> As mediators, the priests maintain the communication between God and his people Israel. As representatives, the priests have a dual role. When they teach the people, the priests are representatives of God, promulgating his will and commandments. When they serve at the altar, sacrificing the holy offerings of Israel, they are Israel's representatives in front of the deity. Thus the priests within this system have a high degree of responsibility accompanied by high privileges. [...] the special holiness of the priests is not restricted to cult or ritual activities alone, but is also related to certain expectations of the community regarding their social behavior&#148; (Hieke, pp. 183-185).</li>
<li><b>Levites</b>: &#147;The term <a href="https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9866-levites-temple-servants" target="_blank">"Levites"</a> applies to members of the tribe of Levi as well as to servants (or ministers) at the sanctuary (in Jerusalem). In the latter usage, "Levites" are <b>ritual experts</b>, however, they perform different functions in the various parts of the Hebrew Bible&#148; (Hieke, p. 185).</li>
<li><b>Cult prophets</b>: &#147;Within Biblical Hebrew, there is no specific term for "cult prophet." However, there
probably was a certain class of cult officials who had to advise the king by figuring out the divine will (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=14&prq=7&psq=26&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ezek 7:26</a>; in analogy to the praxis in the ancient Near East). This sort of "prophet" works at the temple like the priests and the sages &#148; (Hieke, p. 186).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>

<li><b>Sacred and rituals times</b><a href="#*16">*</a>: &#147;In the religion of ancient Israel and its neighbors the connection between time and divine worship is rooted in humankind's need for temporal guidelines to maintain a proper schedule of offerings. According to ancient Near Eastern literature, including the Hebrew Bible, these guidelines were provided with the <b>creation</b> of celestial bodies that ensured the accurate <b>division of time</b>. The Babylonian myth <i>Enuma Elish</i><a name="*22">*</a>, for example, intertwines Marduk's fashioning of the stars and moon with his creation of the year, months, and days (<a href="http://etana.org/node/581" target="_blank">Tablet 5, lines 1-22</a>), and according to the Priestly creation story of the Hebrew Bible the lights in the sky mark the seasons, days, and years (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=1&psq=14&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Gen 1:14</a>). The division of time indicated by these celestial bodies made possible a festival calendar<a href="#*17">*</a> that provided consistency and regularity to the worship of gods, and some rituals continue to reflect the originating connection between sacred time and creation. For example, the <i>Enuma Elish</i> was recited at the annual Babylonian Akitu (New Year's) Festival<a href="#*18">*</a>, an eleven-day event, originally coinciding with the equinoxes, that celebrated the renewal of creation, and in ancient Israel God's rest on the seventh day (Heb. <a href="https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13465-shabbat" target="_blank"><i>&#353;abb&#257;t</i></a>) was an organizing principle for parts of its cultic life. These examples represent a widespread assumption in the ancient Near East that time was sacred because it was created by god(s) and that humans participate in this sacred time through worship. This worship follows <b>a calendar whose units of time were established at creation</b><a href="#Note18"><sup>Note 18</sup></a><a name="Back18"></a> and correspond to other parts of the created order&#148; (Davis, p. 195).</li>
<br>
<li><b>Ritual objects</b>: &#147;The Hebrew Bible refers to a wide range of material artifacts in connection to worship and ritual activities. These include the ark, altars, wash basins, censers, tables, lampstands, and various other items. During the fall of Jerusalem, these objects were destroyed and some were brought back to Babylon as spoils of war (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=11&prq=25&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">2 Kgs 25:13-17</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=13&prq=52&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">Jer 52:17-23</a>). Certain cultic objects deemed to be illicit, such as <b>idols</b>, pillars, sacred poles, and the bronze serpent, are critiqued by the prophets and are the target of the cult reforms of Hezekiah (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=11&prq=18&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">2 Kgs 18:1-6</a>) and Josiah (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=11&prq=23&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">2 Kgs 23:1-20</a>). For much of the history of biblical scholarship, especially in Protestant circles, the importance of ritual objects has often been downplayed if not altogether dismissed. Some have suggested that any connection between Yahweh and the natural or material world was the result of <b>Canaanite influence</b><a href="#*19">*</a>. As a form of syncretism, this aspect of early Israelite religion was eventually overcome through a theological emphasis on Yahweh's <b>transcendence beyond image</b>, object, and locality. Other interpreters have concluded that a concern for ritual and ritual objects only emerged in the latter stages of the Hebrew Bible's literary growth and thus reflected a <b>priestly corruption</b> of earlier forms of religion&#148; (Bonfiglio, p. 207).</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Cultic statues</b>: &#147;The central ritual object in most ancient Near Eastern religion was a freestanding cult
statue. Referred to as an <b>"idol"</b> or "graven image" (<i>pesel</i>) in the HB, a cult statue was typically anthropomorphic in form and fashioned from wood or stone, overlaid with precious metal, and housed in a temple. Rather than being seen only as an image of a god, the cult statue was understood to serve as a conduit for divine disclosure insofar as the real presence of the deity was thought to dwell in the material form of the object. However, the connection between the deity and the image was not automatic or inherent. Rather, it was conferred through special <b>consecration ceremonies</b>, known as the washing of the mouth (<i>m&#299;s p&#299;</i>) or opening of the mouth (<i>p&#299;t p&#299;</i>)<a href="#Note14"><sup>Note 14</sup></a><a name="Back14b"></a>. Through these rituals, the statue's senses were activated, transforming it into an epiphany of the deity. This understanding explains why cult statues were routinely fed, clothed, washed, anointed, perfumed, and processed as part of the regular operation of ANE temples. Almost without exception, the HB <b>condemns</b> the making and use of <b>cult statues</b>&#148; (Bonfiglio, p. 208).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Ritual practices</b>:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>ANE</b>: &#147;Ritual practices in the ancient Near East (ANE) were supposed to establish, maintain, repair, or utilize relationships with powerful superhuman beings who ruled or otherwise affected human life within the interactive cosmic community. [...] Religious activities reflected and affected human societies and cultures in profound ways, but the ANE peoples themselves were primarily concerned with the larger "society" that included deities. Humans fostered beneficial relations by constructing and maintaining their temples, by giving them gifts, and by carrying out performances <b>for</b></b><a href="#*20">*</a> <a href="#Note2"><sup>Note 2</sup></a><a name="Back2b"></a> them&#148; (Gane, p. 223).</li>
<li><b>Israel</b>: &#147;Israel's unique monotheism simplified its cult because it only had to relate to one deity. The real, immanent presence of YHWH himself at his sanctuary, instead of an idolatrous material representation, greatly raised the rewards and risks of interaction with him and the level of accountability to his rules&#148; (Gane, p. 224).</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Prayer</b>: &#147;In the Hebrew Bible, prayer could be directed to God at his sanctuary/temple (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=1&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">1 Sam 1:9-12</a>), toward the place of the temple (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=10&prq=8&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">1 Kgs 8:29-30, 35</a>), or to God without apparent reference to the sanctuary/temple (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=11&prq=4&psq=33&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">2 Kgs 4:33</a>). Speech in conversation with a theophanic manifestation of God (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=18&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Gen 18</a>) also could be regarded as a form of prayer. Except for a unique declaration of innocence and petition for corporate absolution by elders regarding an unsolved murder (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=21&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut 21:7-8</a>), biblical prayers are not prescribed for repeated use, unlike some prayers in ritual contexts recorded in other ANE texts. However, the formulaic "priestly blessing" (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=6&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 6:22-27</a>) and conditional oath/curse uttered by the suspected adulteress (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=5&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">5:19-22</a>) resemble prayers in that they call upon God (albeit indirectly) to act&#148; (Gane, p. 224).</li>
<li><b>Sacrificial rituals</b>: &#147;Religious rituals are formulaic activity systems that are believed to interact with deities or with non-material things that affect the divine-human relationship, such as sins or impurities. Sacrifices are rituals that transfer materials, usually food, to deities for some kind of utilization by them. Thus, <b>sacrifices are offerings</b>, whether they are voluntary gifts or mandatory payments. An offering may be simply dedicated to a deity without a sacrifice (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=27&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 27</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=7&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 7</a>), but a sacrifice is a kind of <b>formal presentation of an offering</b><a href="#Note19"><sup>Note 19</sup></a><a name="Back19"></a> that can highlight the superhuman nature of the recipient. Like non-ritual activity systems, rituals are hierarchical, so they can be simple and brief or complex and long. Activities that are united by contributing to a single goal form an <b>individual ritual</b> (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=1&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 1:3-9</a>), which can combine with other individual rituals to form a <b>ritual complex</b> (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=15&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 15:1-16</a>). Ritual complexes can combine at higher hierarchical levels to accomplish greater goals. [...]  Routine maintenance of a shrine could include guarding it, tending its fire, preparing food for one or more deities, and supplying agricultural products for offerings ([e.g.] Hittite "Instructions to Priests and Temple Officials")<a href="#Note20"><sup>Note 20</sup></a><a name="Back20a"></a>&#148; (Gane, p. 225).</li>
<li><b>Non-sacrificial ritual activities</b>:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Purification and Elimination</b>: &#147;The Hittite "Instructions to Priests and Temple Officials"<a href="#Note20"><sup>Note 20</sup></a><a name="Back20b"></a> (§2) observes: "When the servant stands before his master, he (is) washed. He has clothed (himself) in clean (clothes)." Here the "Instructions" use this as an analogy for the respectable manner in which a human should approach a divine master. This principle applied to Israelite priests: Aaron and his sons underwent ablutions before they were initially dressed in their official vestments (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=8&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 8:6-9, 13</a>). Subsequently, the priests were to wash their hands and feet with water drawn from the sacred basin before entering the tabernacle or officiating at the outer altar (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=30&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod 30:19-21</a>), and the high priest was to wash his whole body before officiating the Day of Atonement<a href="#*8">*</a> service (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=4&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 16:4</a>). [...] The Babylonian high priest was to wash with water drawn from the river (Euphrates) before beginning his activities during the New Year Festival of Spring<a href="#*18">*</a>&#148; (Gane, p. 246).</li>
<li><b>Performance, Procession, and Lifestyle</b>: &#147;Israelite singers and instrumental musicians praised and gave thanks to YHWH at his central shrine in Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=38&prq=16&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Chron 16:4-2</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=39&prq=5&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">2 Chron 5:12-13</a>), and the Hebrew Bible records many hymns (<a href="https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5046-degrees-song-of">Psalms</a>) to God, some of which refer to praising God with string, wind, and percussion instruments (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=150&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ps 150</a>). Other ANE peoples, especially Mesopotamians and Egyptians, composed many hymns for their gods. [...] Performances to honor a deity could take place within the context of a <b>ritual procession</b>. <a name="*21">*</a> Processions organized by David to transport YHWH's ark of the covenant to Jerusalem featured singing, instrumental music, and dancing (including by the king himself) before YHWH (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=9&prq=6&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">2 Sam 6:5, 14-16</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=38&prq=13&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Chron 13:8</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=38&prq=15&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">15:16-22, 24, 28-29</a>). Musicians, singers, and dancers also participated in a magnificent cultic parade during the Babylonian New Year Festival<a href="#*18">*</a>. In some Hittite processions, musicians played harps and tambourines before the (idol of the) god Telipinu and girls sang behind him. During one such journey, wrestlers performed before Telipinu, apparently to entertain him<a href="#Note21"><sup>Note 21</sup></a><a name="Back21"></a>&#148; (Gane, p. 248).</li>
<li><b>Ritual Speech and Reciting</b>: &#147;ANE formulaic speech included spells, such as to assist deceased spirits, and incantations to counter various kinds of evils and dangers, for example, sorcery, snakes, sickness, and evil spirits. These were lacking in the Israelite ritual system, which depended on <b>YHWH's power alone</b>. Babylonians and Israelites practiced the regular recitation/reading of sacred texts, but in different ways. On Nisannu 4 during the Babylonian New Year Festival<a href="#*18">*</a>, the high priest was to recite the <i>Enuma Elish</i><a href="#*22">*</a> to the god <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html" target="_blank">Marduk</a>. This creation myth culminates in the exaltation of <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html" target="_blank">Marduk</a>, city god of Babylon, to kingship over the gods. So presumably the private recitation honored the deity and celebrated the greatness of Babylon and its divinely established order. Every seven years during the Festival of Booths, the Israelite priests and elders were to have YHWH's Torah/Instruction, comprising the terms of the covenant between God and Israel, read to all Israelites, including men, women, and children, as well as resident aliens (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=5&prq=31&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Deut 31:9-13</a>). Unlike the Babylonian recitation, this reading was <b>public</b> and the audience was <b>human</b>&#148; (Gane, p. 249).</li>
<li><b>Divination and Magic</b>: &#147;ANE peoples believed that deities possessed much greater perception and knowledge than humans, including the ability to see what is going on in human hearts/minds (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=16&psq=7&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Sam 16:7</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=27&prq=139&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Ps 139</a> [...]). Deities were volitional beings who could disclose secret knowledge if they chose to do so (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=35&prq=2&psq=11&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Dan 2:11</a>). YHWH revealed hidden information (e.g., <a href="">2 Kgs 6:8-12</a>), including regarding the future (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=35&prq=2&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Dan 2, 7-12</a>), through means of communication such as prophecy, which could be received in ways such as visions and dreams (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=12&psq=6&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 12:6</a>). YHWH also divulged secrets by means of physical phenomena that could be observed, including through casting lots (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=6&prq=7&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Josh 7:14-23</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=10&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Sam 10:20-23</a>; cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=19&prq=1&psq=7&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Jon 1:7</a>), the sacred lot/oracle of the <a href="https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14609-urim-and-thummim" target="_blank">Urim and Thummim</a> worn by the high priest (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=28&psq=30&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod 28:30</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=27&psq=21&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 27:21</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=14&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Sam 14:36-43</a>), and the results of the suspected adulteress ritual (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=5&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 5:11-31</a> [...]). In a broad sense, all of these Yahwistic modes of revelation, which transcended interhuman capabilities of communication, could come under the category of "divination." However, according to the Bible, they were under <b>YHWH's control</b> and did not involve interaction with other superhuman beings or forces. Biblical law strictly prohibited Israelites from resorting to occult or magical sources of knowledge&#148; (Gane, pp. 249-250)<a href="#Note22"><sup>Note 22</sup></a><a name="Back22"></a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Ritual gestures</b>: &#147;ANE ritual practices included a number of distinctive and significant physical gestures. Temple officials could stand before a deity or symbol of divine presence as a servant could stand before a master in readiness to serve him/her (Hittite "Instructions"<a href="#Note20">Note 20</a><a name="Back20c"></a> [...]). Other people could stand before a deity or symbol in order to witness and participate in worship or make offerings (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=9&psq=5&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 9:5</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=10&prq=3&psq=15&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">1 Kgs 3:15</a>), or to wait upon and petition the deity (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=39&prq=20&psq=13&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">2 Chr 20:13</a>). [...] Worshipers or persons praying could <b>raise their hands</b><a href="#*23">*</a>, bow, kneel, or prostrate themselves before a deity or his/her material representation as an image or symbol ([...] forbidden to Israelites in <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=20&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod 20:5</a>), as an individual could show respect in such ways to a higher status human (e.g., <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=34&prq=3&psq=2&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Est 3:2</a>). Gestures of <b>anointing</b><a href="#*24">*</a> <a href="#Note23"><sup>Note 23</sup></a><a name="Back23"></a> could signify bestowal of special status to cultic officials or sacred places or objects. Moses anointed the new Israelite tabernacle, its contents, and the outer altar with sacred anointing oil to consecrate them (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=8&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 8:10-11</a>) and then poured it on Aaron's head to consecrate him as the high priest (v. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=8&psq=12&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">12</a>). Consequently, the high priest could be referred to as "the anointed priest" (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=4&psq=3&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">4:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=6&psq=15&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">6:15</a> [ET 22]), although the other priests were also anointed (<a href="">Exod 40:15</a>) and could be called "anointed priests" (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=4&prq=3&psq=3&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Num 3:3</a>). Similarly, Hittite or Mesopotamian priests could be described as "anointed". In the Israelite cult, the offerer of a sacrifice could lean one hand on the head of an animal to signify that he/she was its owner, who was transferring the animal to sacred utilization and would receive the benefit/efficacy from the deity (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=1&psq=4&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 1:4</a> [...]). The high priest was to lean both hands on the head of Azazel's goat while confessing Israel's moral faults over it, thereby transferring them to the goat (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=16&psq=21&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 16:21</a>). Another kind of gesture practiced by Israelites and Egyptians was the <b>elevation</b> (not waving) of a gift as a gesture of dedicating it to the deity (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=2&prq=29&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Exod 29:26-27</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=3&prq=7&psq=30&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=non" target="_blank">Lev 7:30</a> [...]).&#148; (Gane, p. 251).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Function of rituals</b>: &#147;The focus in what follows will be on three important characteristics of ritual, including (1) ritual as an integral part of human existence and its role in the biblical text; (2) ritual as a vehicle for complex concepts; and (3) ritual and its relationship to worship against the backdrop of the relational concept of the "I and Thou" connecting humanity with the divine&#148; (Klingbeil, p. 490).</li>
<ol>
<li><b>Integral part of existence</b>: &#147;Every ritual, sacred or secular, points beyond itself and wants to communicate or critique (see the later discussion of ritual innovation). Knowledge and ritual are integrally related to each other in many biblical texts. Ritual requires a specific <b>space, time, occasion, and participants</b> to achieve a particular outcome. This definition alone requires the reader of ritual texts (including the many biblical ritual texts) to pay attention to the emotions, underlying message, and outcome evoked, associated with, attributed to or accomplished by the ritual. Thus it seems that rituals have both a pre-life as well as an afterlife. The pre-life centers around what triggers a ritual; the afterlife concerns what the ritual purports to accomplish&#148; (Klingbeil, p. 491).</li>
<li><b>Vehicle for complex concepts</b>: &#147;Rituals are a powerful vehicle to communicate often complex ideas and concepts. Ritual shorthand implies abbreviation and familiarity with generally recognized ritual building blocks. An intriguing example of the <b>ability of rituals to abbreviate and communicate complex concepts</b> can be found in the altar construction texts in Genesis (<a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=8&psq=20&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">8:20</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=12&psq=7&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">12:7</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=12&psq=8&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">8</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=13&psq=18&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">13:18</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=22&psq=9&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">22:9</a>, <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=22&psq=10&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">10</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=26&psq=25&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">26:25</a>; <a href="https://www.tanakhml.org/d21.php2xml?sfr=1&prq=35&psq=7&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls" target="_blank">35:7</a>). In an earlier study, I have suggested that these short descriptive vignettes of ritual activity in the patriarchal narratives illustrate the power of abbreviation. Abbreviation serves as a means to communicate concepts, similar to a red STOP sign next to the road, warning a driver or pedestrian to pay attention, come to a complete halt, look carefully around, ascertain if and when the journey can continue, and then take off. All these elements are not spelled out on the sign &#8211; yet they are implied, explicitly mentioned in traffic rules, and commonly accepted and enforced by law enforcement authorities&#148; (Klingbeil, p. 492).</li>
<li><b>Medium of worship</b>: &#147;The ability of ritual to build community (or <i>communitas</i> as coined by anthropologist Victor Turner) is an important benefit of integrating <b>ritual as a medium of worship</b> in a time when people living in urban centers feel increasingly isolated and attached to virtual realities. The <b>mnemonic function</b> of ritual can help unlock memories and is a powerful teaching tool. All this, however, requires serious reflection and represents a theological task, if one is to avoid the rut and routine so often condemned by Israel's writing prophets. Ritual activity does not automatically mean theological reflection, but theological reflection can be discerned in ritual activity&#148; (Klingbeil, p. 494).</li>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution investigates the meaning of some technical terms related to <b>cultic activities</b> performed at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four key elements are stressed by the author:<br>

<ol>
<li>the presence of specific priests, considered as 'cultic technicians';</li>
<li>the recurring of determined offerings to the polyad god <b><sup>d</sup>Kura</b>;</li>
<li>the use of ritual terms such as syntagma <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0026258" target="_blank"><b>DU<sub>11</sub>.GA</b></a>, 'order, vow', 'request' and <b>KA.G&#193;.II</b></a> = <b><i>rag&#257;mum</b></i> = <b><i>b&#226;lum</b></i>, 'recited prayer';</li>
<li>the attestation of another ritual figure, expressed by the term <b><i>da-mi-mu</b></i>, 'reciter, lamenter'.</li>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all: &#147;the value that these elements assume is based on the meaning of some keywords, as indicated by Ebla's lexical lists, both on the basis of prosopographic analysis, suggests the identification of an act of worship&#148;; English translation by <a href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/authorship/depietri.htm" target="_blank">mDP</a> (p. 131).<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the article, the author presents many texts from Ebla (such as e.g. <a href="https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P242385" target="_blank"><i>ARET</i> 3.192</a>, in the picture above), sketching a relative chronology of the examined terminology and investigating the <b>diachronic development</b> of the rituals at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank">Ebla/Tell Mardikh</a>.<br>

<small><i>Relief from the side part of a cult basin made of basalt (detail). Found at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>, Tempel B1 (from <A href="https://www.akg-images.com/archive/-2UMDHUFTWJ8H.html" target="_blank"></i>AKG-IMAGES<i></a>)</i></small><br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author goes across archaeological and textual evidence from <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>, aiming at reconstructing some specific ritual dynamics related to the cult of the <b>royal ancestors</b> (the <b><i>Rapi&#700;uma</b></i> or <b><i>Repha&#700;im</b></i> of the texts from <b>Ugarit/Ras Shamra</b>), spanning the Ancient Bronze IVA (ca. 2400-2300 BC) to Iron Age II (ca. 900-720 BC).<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BA IVA texts found in the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html_tablets" target="_blank"><b>Royal Archives of Ebla</b></a> (<A href="http://www.ebla.it/escavi__il_palazzo_reale_g.html" target="_blank"><b>Royal Palace G</b></a>) mention the <b>divinisation</b> of the dead kings and the cult offered to the royal ancestors: the <b>'Ritual of the Regality'</b> (found in L. 2769, ca. 2350-2300 BC), and other documents describe celebrations involving a procession of the royal couple to the sites of <b>Binash</b> and <A href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=36.1389,36.83&q=36.1389,36.83&hl=en&t=m&z=12" target="_blank"><b>Darib</b>/<b>Atareb(?)</b></a> (two royal necropoles), presenting offerings to the royal ancestors.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rituals and offerings addressed to royal cults in <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a> are also attested: in fact, <b>administrative texts</b> quote offerings presented in the Royal Palace to the <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025832" target="_blank">DINDIR</a> <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0026952" target="_blank">EN</a> ('the god of the lord/king'), to the <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025832" target="_blank">DINGIR</a> <i>maliktum</i> ('the god of the queen'), or to the <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025832" target="_blank">DINGIR</a> <i>a-mu</i> ('the god of the father').<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, some <b>banquet scenes</b> attested on the wall of royal hypogea have been interpreted as ritual banquets (such as the <i>kispum</i>) described in contemporary <b>Ugaritic texts</b> of the Late Bronze Age II.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, the structure of the <b>Sanctuary B2</b> (MB II, ca. 1800-1600 BC), discovered in the lower city of <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>, shows a peculiar architecture including a wide room clearly adhibited to ritual banquets (maybe similar to the North-West Semitic <b><i>marzeah</b></i> (see e.g. <A href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23621930" target="_blank">King 1989</a> or to the Mesopotamian <b><i>kispum</b></i> (see e.g. <A href="https://www.academia.edu/10355375/Remembrance_and_the_Dead_in_Second_Millennium_BC_Mesopotamia_full_text" target="_blank">Mac Dougal 2014</a>) with many participants. These banquets were performed on the occasion of the death of the reigning king, to guarantee him the assumption among the ancestors.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hypothesis is strengthened by a <b>steatite cylindrical seal</b> (Erlenmeyer Collection; Paleo-Assyrian period, unknown provenance but possibly from <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank"><b>Ebla/Tell Mardikh</b></a>) depicts three scenes involving gods of <A href="http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#6054" target="_blank">Yamkhad</a> and the <i>rapi&#700;uma</i> of <A href="https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/540/mode/2up" target="_blank">Halab</a>, probably on the occasion of the death of a Syrian king.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short: &#147;The tradition of deification of deceased kings and the faith in an essential protection provided by these deified beings to the community of the living, the reigning house, and the whole society, go back, in Syria, to the very beginning of urban life, in Proto-Syrian times and in the sudden growth of Ebla at the acme of the 'second urbanization', shortly after the middle of the third millennium BC, when the rituals of the Royal Archives testify to the role of the deified dead kings in the renewal of the reigning kings&#148; (p. 991; English translation by <a href="http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/authorship/depietri.htm" target="_blank">mDP</a>).<br>
<br>

[Note that the hypothesis of divinisation of kings at Ebla has not been considered in Giorgio Buccellati's volume, since the present paper by P. Matthiae has been published later].<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author presents in this paper a discussion on some rituals<a href="#ViganoNote1"><sup>Note 1</sup></a><a name="BackVigano1"></a> attested in documents from the Archives of the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/escavi__il_palazzo_reale_g.html" target="_blank"><b>Royal Palace G</b></a> at Ebla: the <i>Purification Ritual</i><a name="*6">*</a> (= L. 2679), <i>rituals of Regular Offerings</i> (<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0026251" target="_blank">dug<sub>4</sub>-ga</a> <i>i-sa-r&#237; / i-sa-i</i>), and the so-called '<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0024669" target="_blank">a:tu<sub>5</sub></a> ritual'<a href="#ViganoNote2"><sup>Note 2</sup></a><a name="BackVigano2"></a>.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ritual includes four key-elements (cf. <A href="http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Bonechi1989" target="_blank">Bonechi 1989</a>:<br>
<ol>
<li>the presence of the 'purification priest' <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0023102" target="_blank">A</a>:<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0034782" target="_blank">NAGA</a> = <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0024669" target="_blank">a:tu<sub>5</sub></a>;</li>
<li>an offering to the god <sup>d</sup>KU-<i>ra</i> performed by a priest with the title '<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0036718" target="_blank">pa<sub>4</sub>:&#353;e&#353;</a> (= <i>pa&#353;i&#353;u</i>) <sup>d</sup>KU-<i>ra</i>';</li>
<li>the association of 2. to <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0026251" target="_blank">dug<sub>4</sub>-ga</a> <i>i-sa-r&#237;</i>, probably an offering consisting of garments and wool;</li> 
<li>the attestation of the term <i>da-mi-mu</i> ('reciter, lamenter').</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a discussion on the <i>Regular Offerings</i>-ritual, the author moves to the analysis of the '<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0024669" target="_blank">a:tu<sub>5</sub></a> ritual'; specifically, the scholar underscores what follows: &#147;the presentation of the main elements of the so-called <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0024669" target="_blank">a:tu<sub>5</sub></a> ritual prompts the legitimate question of whether all these segments belong to one ceremony, even though they are registered in the MAT reports as separate items. [...] I think it would not be wrong to join Bonechi (see <A href="http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Bonechi1989" target="_blank">Bonechi 1989</a>) in stating that they are parts of the same ceremony and that it probably took place in the temple of the Ebla patron deities&#148; (p. 221).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author further analyses in this contribution (a follow-up to his 'Rituals at Ebla,' [<A href="http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Viganò1995Rituals" target="_blank">Vigan&#242; 1995</a>]) the ritual text <a href="https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/archival_view.php?ObjectID=P241303" target="_blank">TM 1730</a> (see <i>supra</i>), comparing this document with other <b>purification rituals</b>, such as the '&#236;-gi&#353; sag ritual', whose actual performance has been considered by some scholars as a proper 'purification ritual', while others have advanced the interpretation of a purification ritual performed before the <b>anointing</b><a name="*24">*</a> of the head.<br> 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further comparison is presented with the <b><a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037931" target="_blank">sikil</a>-ritual</b>, 'the purification, cleansing ceremony', displaying texts from the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html_tablets" target="_blank"><b>Royal Archives of Ebla</b></a>.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author specifically reconnects the <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0024669" target="_blank">a:tu<sub>5</sub></a>-ritual<a href="#Vigano2Note1"><sup>Note 1</sup></a><a name="BackVigano2_1"> to the crowning of the new king ('en') at Ebla: the '<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0030477" target="_blank">&#236;</a>-<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0028412" target="_blank">gi&#353;</a> <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037222" target="_blank">sag</a>-ritual' concerns the use of <b>oil</b> (<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0030823">&#236;-gi&#353;</a>, lit. 'sesame oil'), during the ritual action of the anointment of the new enthroned king (a practice well attested both in the <a href="https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1559-anointing" target="_blank">Bible</a> and also in the sacral consecration of a new bride of Egyptian pharaohs, such in the case of the first Hittite marriage between Ramses II and a daughter of the Hittite king &#7722;attu&#353;ili III (named in Egyptian Maat&#7717;orneferure), see e.g. text KUB XXVI 53 (<A href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/hetkonk/hetkonk_abfrage.php?c=735" target="_blank">CTH 735</a>), and also in the Amarna correspondence, in a letter between Amen&#7717;otep III and Tar&#7723;undaradu, king of Arzawa (<A href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/hetkonk/hetkonk_abfrage.php?c=151" target="_blank">CTH 151 = EA 31</a>). This practice of anointing the head of the new king was perpetrated during the Middle Ages, when a new sovereign was anointed by the Pope with the sacred Chrism, a ritual also well known as for the <b>baptism</b> in the Catholic Church tradition (see e.g. <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm" target="_blank">The Catechism of the Holy Church</a>, under no. 1241). The author reports some instances when the performing of the anointment ritual was the topic (pp. 16-18). In some cases, a similar ritual was applied to <b>funerary ceremonies</b>, too, as described on pp. 18-19.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other 'cleansing ceremonies' practised at <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank">Ebla</a>, called <b><a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037931" target="_blank">'sikil'</a>-ritual(s)</b> are taken into acoount: &#147;Almost all the examples referring to this ritual are derived from the <i>ARE</i> reports that register the amounts of gold and silver used to manufacture objects offered to different deities during the illness of some important member of the <A href="http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html" target="_blank">Ebla</a> upper class&#148; (p. 21). &#147;'The anointing of the head' (<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0030477" target="_blank">&#236;</a>-<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0028412" target="_blank">gi&#353;</a> <a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037222" target="_blank">sag</a>-ritual) is not restricted to use in a funerary ceremony. Such a practice is performed for weddings and other occasions in which oil does not play the role of a cleansing element but is part of a ceremony of joy and celebration. Finally, the 'purification' (<a href="http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0037931" target="_blank">sikil</a>) is performed in cases of <b>illness</b> that sometimes ended in death&#148; (p. 22).<br>

It is also remarkable that a similar ritual is attested in Egypt (the "Opening of the Mouth Ritual", OMR) which served to some extent the same purpose (even if it was also performed on the body of a dead person in order to guarantee him/her the possibility of an active and "living" afterlife). <small><sub><a href="#Back14a">Back to text, a</a>; <a href="#Back14b">Back to text, b</a></sub></small></li>
