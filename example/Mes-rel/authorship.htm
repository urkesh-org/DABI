<h3>Editors</h3>

<h3>Collaborators</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several collaborators have worked and are currently working on individual entries for the website. <A href="intro/collaboration.htm#authorship">Identification of authorship</A> is of particular importance, and in the website this is done in two parallel ways.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) <b><i>Each page or section of a page</i></b> records the name of the author and the date. This applies also for short individual records as is the case of the <a href="sub-notes.htm" target="notes">notes</a>. Where an entry is not so labeled, the main editor is responsible for it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) <b><i>In this section, the links in the left side bar</i></b> refer to a page devoted to each individual contributor who has worked on this digital resource. In these author pages, a complete list is given of all entries they have authored, inluding single footnotes. These indices are produced by the DABI <a href="data/DABI.htm">program</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration to the website is possible in the form of a a monitored forum. Details are given in the section on <a href="sub-data.htm" target="data">data handling</a>.<br>
