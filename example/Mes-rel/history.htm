FOLLOWING IS A STUB FOR THE ENTIRE SECTION<br>
<br>
<i>When on High the Heavens</i>, and this accompanying website which documents the sources of the published volume, may be situated within the complex history of several distinct disciplines. Buccellati's work is, as its subtitle suggests, to some extent a work of "comparative religion". It is also, and more directly, the heir of two older areas of study, namely Biblical studies and Mesopotamian studies. Further, the underlying method which proposes a "structural comparison" of two spiritualities, which is also elaborated in several other major works by Buccellati (see, for instance, his <a href="https://4banks.net/Akk-lg/akk-lg.htm"><i>Structural Grammar of Babylonian</i></a> and <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/"><i>Critique of Archaelogical Reason</i></a>), can be placed in relation to the tradition that goes by the name of structuralism, and involves linguistics as well as philosophy, anthropology and archaeology. This article aims briefly to give the larger context of the disciplines involved in the specific study proposed in this website.

    <h3>Biblical studies</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writings known collectively as the Bible have a long and complex history. They were written, revised, read, and commented for centuries before the beginning of what in the West can be conveniently referred to as the Christian era. After the destruction of the second temple and in light of the ensuing diaspora, further layers of interpretation were developed within the Jewish community with the explicit aim to "build a hedge around the Torah". That stage in development was further complicated by the Christian re-interpretation of the same scriptures, their inclusion in an authoritatively defined "canon", and by their translation into languages that heretofore had not hosted the Jewish religious texts. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textual transmission of these writings over the following centuries was complex, and susceptible to theologically loaded translations as well as scribal errors or omissions. After the first formative centuries of the Christian era, the transmitted text was substantially unvaried (in Latin, in the version produced by Jerome) and largely read only by the official clergy.
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation obtained until the age of Erasmus of Rotterdam (1467-1536) and Martin Luther (1483-1546). The Bible was translated into a modern language, and widely disseminated among the population thanks to the recent invention of the printing press. Erasmus pioneered a textual critical method that attempted to amend the text of the Gospels, and in a first, published his results. Together with the renewed interest in classical studies and methods that began in the Renaissance, this event led to new approaches to the Bible that had not been attempted before.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 19th century, textual criticism was practiced widely in the Protestant milieu, and attracted and influenced Catholic scholars to the point that a series of papal declarations were emitted in order to clarify which methods were considered usable within the complex Catholic approach to interpretation, which admits not only textual criticism, but also arguments from tradition and from authority. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Modernist controversy", as the related (but wider) debate about Catholic theology at the turn of the Twentieth century has been called, came to a head with the publication of the 'small syllabus' <i>Lamentabili sane</i>, promulgated by Pius X in July of 1907. The list contains some propositions which are still the objects of theological and exegetical questioning, particularly around the methods of interpretation to be applied to Sacred scripture. For instance, point 12 condemns the proposition that 'If he wishes to apply himself usefully to Biblical studies, the exegete must first put aside all preconceived opinions about the supernatural origin of Sacred scripture and interpret it the same as any other merely human document'. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Vatican II documents in the Catholic Church, especially <i>Dei Verbum</i> and <i>The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church</i>, are the fruit of a century's work on reconciling different interpretative methods. Yet even today it is not infrequent to hear seminarians in the theological faculties and pastors in their parishes complain of the excessive atomization of scripture through textual criticism. Some conclude that the only really useful work to be done is the re-appropriation of the 'great Doctors' referred to but not named in <i>Pascendi</i>, to the exclusion of critical methods. A similar stance can be found in the various Fundamentalist readings of the Bible, which propose a literal interpretation of many passages that are contradictory to the findings of modern science. These readings do not interest us directly, but are a politically and socially important approach to interpreting the Bible.
    
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
    
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most readings of the Bible are the expression of a faith community, and are defined by the interpretation given to certain key passages. These passages are in turn interpreted using instruments that produce the 'right' answer, which leads to a difficult relationship between Biblical studies and the scientific instruments of philology. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one area which distinguishes the present work. Buccellati makes no secret of the fact that he was raised and educated within the Catholic tradition. Several of his books contain prefaces or dedications to churchmen. Within the present volume, a sympathetic evaluation, perhaps the fruit of personal conviction, can be noticed in several passages which connect the two spiritualities that are the direct focus of attention (Mesopotamian and Biblical spirituality) to the later Christian spirituality. The same fact can be noticed in Buccellati's articles in the pages of the North American edition of Communio. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's expressed position is that it is possible to have a personal creed, to belong to the intellectual tradition of humanism, and to carry out serious scientific work, deploying all the critical tools at his disposal. He affirms that all scholars have a personal starting-point, which must be declared and kept in mind when interpreting other traditions. The neutrality of the scholar seems to be a chimera, which should give way instead to a frank declaration of one's starting point as well as an empathetic and scientifically valid examination of the object of study. <br>

    <h3>Comparative religion</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the flurry of activity around Biblical studies and the first discoveries in archaeology in the early nineteenth century, a separate discipline known as "comparative religion", "history of religion(s)" and recently more generally as "religious studies" has emerged. Although the title of this discipline is still a matter of debate, in this context we prefer the specific term "comparative" because it is linked to the way Buccellati describes his own project as a "structural comparison". His efforts are not in full continuity with the "comparative religion" enterprise, but there are also several significant connections. The main source of what follows is Sharpe's <i>Comparative Religion: A History</i> (1986).

    <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
    
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific study of religion gradually developed out of the greatly broadened world-view that resulted from European exploration of the rest of the world during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. While until that time, the mostly Christian west could look with some condescension upon the rest of the world as composed of Jews, Moors, and Pagans, after having direct contact with the great variety of other religious practices and beliefs this view was no longer possible. Christendom's view of other religions began to be recast through the acute and sympathetic observations of missionaries like Matteo Ricci, whose work was characterized by a deep appreciation for the spirituality they encountered. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the specific example of Ricci, Sharpe affirms that "the 'religion' of China, without mysteries, without 'priestcraft', and inculcating a lofty moral ideal, provided - or appeared to provide - a welcome proof that, as certain European savants were claiming, the essence of religion was of precisely this nature, and that all later elaborations on this simple theme were both unnecessary and undesirable." (Sharpe, p. 15) The "savants" to whom Sharpe alludes were precursors of the "deists", who began to view all things religious as if from a neutral height, untouched by the specifics of a creed and a history, instead affirming only the outlines of a Supreme Power as god. Many further developments occurred: Hegel proposed his all-encompassing history of the Spirit, crowned with Christianity. Darwin and others proposed various forms of evolution that were applied first to the natural sciences, and soon thereafter to religion too. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals were not always neutral and detached; see for instance John Tyndall's 1874 phrase "We claim, and we shall wrest from theology, the entire domain of cosmological theory. All schemes and systems which thus infringe upon the domain of science must, in so far as they do this, submit to its control and relinquish all thought of controlling it" (in Sharpe, p. 29). A less antagonistic view, although perhaps overly optimistic, was expressed by Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller in 1867: "The Science of Religion may be the last of the sciences which man is destined to elaborate; but when it is elaborated, it will change the aspect of the world, and give new life to Christianity itself." (in Sharpe, p. 31). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&uuml;ller produced a method that "can be characterised as scientific, critical, historical and comparative: scientific because of its inductive pattern and its belief in universal laws of cause and effect, and because of its distrust of obvious a priori arguments; critical because of its fundamental attitude to evidence; historical because of the new sense of continuity between the past and the present to which it gave rise; comparative because it claimed comparison to be the basis of all knowledge. It compared the known with the unknown, it compared phenomena in apparent temporal sequence, it compared phenomena belonging to different areas but having features in common. In all this, in true scientific spirit, it set out to determine, with regard to religion, the genus 'religion' which underlay the species 'the religions'." (Sharpe, p. 31-32).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a naive reading, this is still a project that can be considered valid. One of the fundamental activites of the human brain is pattern recognition: things are grouped by commonality or distinguished by differences. The language of "species" and "genus" as applied to culture or religion has been rightly criticized for begging important questions, and even for creating overarching groups where what actually exists are only distinct experiences that bear no real commonality. It may be objected, however, that all language depends on the interplay of incomplete signs that refer to other realities. We will return to this issue later in this article in the discussion of structuralism and Buccellati's proposed way out of the impasse.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the turn of the twentieth century, the work of J. G. Frazer gave impetus to the burgeoning project of comparative religion. His <i>The Golden Bough</i>, while repudiated by recent generations of scholars in the various disciplines affected by his scholarship (anthropology, philosophy, theology, sociology...), was enormously influential. According to Cairns Craig, this was because Frazer's work "collapsed traditional conceptions of progressive history, revealing that the past that modern humanity thought it had left behind still shadowed its contemporary existence and was, indeed, more pervasive in modern consciousness than the discoveries of science made over the last four hundred years. Frazer's presentation of the history of humanity negated both the eighteenth-century Enlightenment and the nineteenth-century social Darwinist conceptions of continuous progressive improvement towards ever-higher levels of rationality." (Introduction to <i>The Golden Bough</i>, 16). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-twentieth century, no name was more influential in comparative religion than Mircea Eliade. He proposed a cross-cultural reading of data from a large variety of religious traditions, and presented his data as an objective description, free from value judgments. He gathered and presented his data under such categories as "the sacred", the "center of the world" (<i>axis mundi</i>), the "great" times of origin, distinct from chronological time. These categories are related to many symbols in the natural world, such as the transcendence of the sky, the sun, the waxing and waning of the moon, water, stones, fertility. One of his important works on this topic was <a href="https://4banks.net/Mes-Rel/Excerpts/Eliade1958Patterns.htm"><i>Patterns in Comparative Religion</i></a>, published in 1958. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent generations of scholars have questioned Eliade's project on the grounds that he imposes abstract "platonizing" categories on human experience, and thus suppresses difference. The comparative approach, it is suggested, "conjures and imposes abstracted categories that too often erase culturally embedded distinctions and realities" (Dempsey, p. 5). Even the term "religion" has come under fire for being ethnocentric (Bianchi 1993, 350).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ugo Bianchi, an Italian scholar of the history of religion who served as the president of the IAHR, repeatedly attempted to steer a middle ground. In 1985, he defended his approach against claims of imperialism. In a 1993 article, he pointed out that Eliade's hermeneutics "opposing substance (the purely "religious") with accidents (its different cultural and historical incarnations)", is "antithetical to the inductive stance of the history of religions." (Bianchi 1993, p. 351). According to Bianchi, "the struggle against <i>a priori</i> reductionism, whether theoretical, ideological, or programmatic, is fought not so much with contrary assumptions as with sound, comparative, cultural-historical research. Once the issue of the relations between religion and other cultural elements is posited in the ambit of comparative-historical research, it reveals clearly the full, specific "weight" of religion, both phenomenological and historical, and as a result discourages overly bold attempts to explain away or to reduce, that is, to formulate incomplete interpretations." (Bianchi 1985, p. 54). An important contribution by Bianchi was his insistence on the concept of analogy as a way to avoid the unacceptable alternatives between reductionism and ideology. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate is far from over. A 2002 conference, the proceedings of which were published as <i>How to do Comparative Religion</i> (Ren&eacute; Goth&oacute;ni, ed., 2005), highlighted yet again the divide between reductionist approaches and hermeutical or phenomenological approaches. This divide is also referred to as being between 'science' and 'religion', in which the former coincides with truth and certainty, and the second with irrationality and belief. There are more nuanced ways of understanding these alternatives. One, represented by the editors of the 2002 proceedings, is to consider with Protagoras that every argument has a justified counter-argument. Debate, then, is the necessary and proper way to mediate alternative accounts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Buccellati, monotheism and polytheism represent two alternative ways to interpret the complex of relations between humans and the 'absolute'. Each system proposes its 'laws', which are internally coherent, even if they cannot necessarily be evaluated with respect to each other. Both interpretations are valid, deeply interesting, and valuable for the contemporary reader, whatever religious or nonreligious perspective she may have. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparative approach is not finished, notwithstanding the criticisms that correctly can be brought to bear against it. Comparison is an unavoidable characteristic of all human observation and production of thoughts and communication. As Corinne Dempsey puts it, "The question then becomes not whether we should compare but, in comparing, how we can do so transparently and responsibly. How do we choose among infinitely available points of comparison such that the process advances rather than predetermines or undermines our knowledge of religious phenomena?" (Depsey, p. 4) One useful signpost was given by Wilfred Cantwell Smith (1916-2000), who proposed that the comparative study of religion should describe the faith of other peoples' in such a way that those people could recognize themselves in the description.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buccellati's approach in the present work attempts to respond in detail to both of these suggestions.<br><br>

    <h3>Mesopotamian studies</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buccellati's main field of study regards the history and archaeology of Mesopotamia, and When on High the Heavens is part of a larger project that aims to describe several major aspects of Mesopotamian civilization. We now concentrate our gaze on this region as it bears on the study of religion.

    <h3>Structuralism and cognitive science: recent developments</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Structuralism presents itself rather as a mode of interpreting previously acquired data than as data source. In its beginnings it aimed at nothing short of the construction of a scientific method for the elucidation of practically all human phenomena." (Sharpe, 313)
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hans Penner in 1985 "I think that theoretical developments in the study of religion which advance our knowledge of this subject will come from developmemts in linguistics : the study of linguistics is the necessary foundation for explanations of religion." (in Sharpe, 314)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The danger is perhaps that of superimposing the mind (and its structures) of the observer upon the mind of the believer in such a way as to produce a pat tern-or a structure-totally foreign to the believer's own perceptions and intentions." (Sharpe, 314)<br>
    
    Levi-Strauss
    
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much debate has accompanied the questions regarding 'universals' in every area of scholarship for centuries. In the study of religion or spirituality, this question arises regarding the very term 'religion', which for a time was considered a neutral category that could contain a variety of expressions. More recently, this approach has been widely criticized, and the literature is full of caveats regarding the applicability of such a term. See, for example, the debates about whether or not Confucianism or Buddhism are to be regarded as "religions". Likewise, Eliade's proposal of the category of the 'sacred' as a central and universal human category has come under fire. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The link was one of language ; but establish a link between language and culture, and who could tell what might not be achieved." (Sharpe, 22)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without universals, how can communication happen? Without an overall category within which to situate a given phenomenon, how can it be studied? And yet: we are also all too aware of the fact that any categorization inevitably colors the phenomenon that is so categorized. From this awareness arises a tendency to seek a 'pure reason' that can examine phenomena without being affected by them. This tendency has an illustrious pedigree, from Descartes to our day, but fails to recognize that such 'pure' unembodied rationality does not ever actually exist. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem, then that we are left only with 'similarities and differences', analogies. Such an outcome may seem to renounce the ontological certainties that theology proposes, and hard science would replace—but recent cognitive science research suggests that in fact the brain mostly deals in analogies, both on the level of its architecture and processing methodology and on the level of its heuristic decision-making. Boyer, a proponent of a cognitive approach to the study of religion, proposes that religions offer a "minimally counter intuitive" way to reconcile explicit violation of some intuitive principles with the implicit confirmation of other intuitive principles. But "empiric knowledge" is not actually how the brain knows things. Boyer is probably not a cartesian, yet he (unwittingly?) imposes a rationalistic, "enlightenment" idea of measurement and precision on processes that are stochastic and approximate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other scholars suggest that historical research is a "laudable endeavor", but must be augmented in order to address the "universal questions", which cannot be done "by means of localized interpretations"6. This suggestion must however contend with the fact that in order to address any question, one must have data, and the only data at hand are a) the still-inconclusive research regarding the internal operation of the human brain and b) the artifacts, texts, and rituals present within human activity. To suggest that one may answer universal questions without attention to "localized interpretations" is like suggesting that one may explain chemical (or biological!) systems using only the tools of physics. It appears to be true on a first reading, but one is quickly convinced that in fact many phenomena can only be described at different scales, using the different (and permeable) rules that describe that particular scale of organization. How could a biological system be described using only the tools of Physics, when physicists are unable to produce an analytical solution of the wave equation for anything more complex than a hydrogen atom? Clearly, the intermediate explanatory tools of Chemistry are helpful, even if they are not 'fundamental' in the way that Physics purports to be.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clifford Geertz famously stated that 'culture is indispensable to the construction of mind'7 With regard to developments in neuroscience since that (1973) enunciation, its truth is presumably because the "construction of mind" is the creation of connections between mental processes, which occurs though the encounter with extra-personal beings and actions, is always embodied, and extends by analogy processes regarding visible objects to a presumed invisible world. The point is that the visible world does not sufficiently explain itself, so an invisible world is postulated to explain the phenomena (the same principle as in science, the discovery of bacteria, atoms, etc).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, merely pointing out the fact that the presumedly "hard" sciences are ambiguous would seem to lead us to the same conclusion: it would seem that fields of study like the history of religions are doomed to failure. If the universal term "religion" is an unusable category, and if history is an unworkable method in the face of recent advances in neuroscience, then what remains? In such an event, it would not be surprising if universities were to reduce or eliminate their support of a field that could at best define itself as a "description over time of the presumed relations between humans and a perhaps-immaginary extra-human power"8. But the very extension and continued relevance of religious phenomena (whatever one means by the adjective) shows that (at least) we are in front of a skandalon which shows no signs of courteously leaving the stage. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could the scholars engaged in studying the history of religions, and the critics of their methods, pay due respect to each other's results? How could the just criticism of universalistic language, and the just specification of multiplicity and detail within each cultural unit on whatever scale, be honored without <i>ipso facto</i> renouncing all claim to universality. And this, just when advances in neuroscience and epigenetics show in increasingly clear terms that older concepts like "race" must be abandoned, precisely in favor of the universality of human potential?<br><br>

    <h3>Status quaestionis: Buccellati's contribution in the present work</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One promising way forward, at the juncture of each of the disciplines mentioned above, is represented in Buccellati's comparative studies in Mesopotamian and Biblical religion. 
    Buccellati's starting point is rather similar to that of M&uuml;ller more than a hundred years earlier. M&uuml;ller wrote in 1899 that the origin of religion is when man is brought "in sensuous contact with something not finite like everything else." (in Sharpe, 38). For Buccellati, religion is the relation with the absolute, which although unknown, powerfully and inescapably determines human existence.
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buccellati and M&uuml;ller are similar in another way as well. For the 19th century German, the ultimate aim was to "elaborate a complete science of human thought: and this he chose to do in four stages, beginning with the science of language, and passing through the science of mythology and the science of religion to the final goal of the science of thought." (Sharpe, 40). While Buccellati has no plan to present a complete "science of thought", he too has dedicated a great deal of attention to the linguistic foundation of thought, and aims at a large-scale synthesis such as the current "Four Banks" project (<a href="http://4banks.net"><b>4banks.net</b></a>). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buccellati contends that although no word for "religion" exists in the ancient languages of Babylon, it is nevertheless possible to speak of Mesopotamian religion (or "spirituality", as he prefers to define it). The non-existence of the word does not imply the non-existence of the human experience that is indicated by the word. In Buccellati's view, this human experience is essentially the "interaction with an absolute that remains empirically unknown, but is however empirically presupposed". What is more, this interaction is structured in different ways in different cultures. While a terminological comparison will inevitably run aground on the lack of the relevant terms, or their ambiguity, it is however possible to compare the structures of two different "spiritualities" in a fruitful and scientifically honest manner. This is one possible way to address the problem of "universals" without recourse to a Cartesian impoverishment of vast tracts of human experience. 
    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On science and religion
    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Frazer, as for Hume, it is 'regularity in the succession of phenomena' alone which 'breeds in our mind the conception of a cause' and, 'in the last analysis cause is simply invariable sequence'." (Cairns, p. 29)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frazer found in primitive magic a mistaken application of the same logic that actually underlies modern science so that magic, like science, assumes 'a certain established order of nature on which [man] can surely count, and which he can manipulate to his own ends'. The failure of nature to conform to the magical account of it, however, leads not to the evolution of science but to its replacement with the even more deceptive structures of religion: 'When he discovers his mistake, when he recognises sadly that both the order of nature which he had assumed and the control which he had believed himself to exercise over it were purely imaginary', man 'throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself'." (Cairnes, p. 32)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same understanding of regularity as the issue sought for in the Summa isbu is presented by Buccellati. Here again is a radical difference with Judaism and Christianity: things are as they are because God wills them so; the search for order and logos is still present, but in a personal form: the human person attempts to understand the logos of God's creation, attempts to enter his mind, with the aim to know and understand more than to control.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buccellati's proposal offers a hopeful and intellectually rigorous approach to the problems briefly outlined here. It is unafraid of the encroachment of a new science, since it defines itself in terms that can only be enriched by a more adequate description of reality. It also is unwilling to renounce universality, precisely in the sense that it expects all new science, and all adequate descriptions of reality, to converge. Buccellati proposes in <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/"><i>Critique of Archaelogical Reason</i></a> (Cambridge 2017) a Kant-inspired theory of how to conceive of a hierarchical system of reference points that allows the atoms of sense data to converge in an overall description of a complex reality. Buccellati sees the true finality of his study - and of all humanistic studies - in the formation of a sensibility that is able to encounter an alien culture, and make it one's own, to "reacquire in a reasoned manner a human experience that was literally buried under the weight of its own collapse."<br><br>
