    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="7.1">        <li><p>It is important to distinguish clearly between human perception and the presumed existence of the object or subject that causes that perception. Too close a connection between the two leads Faivre to critique Eliade. Buccellati proposes a way out of the impasse with his distinction between &ldquo;touched&rdquo; and &ldquo;touching&rdquo;. See: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Faivre1995">Faivre 1995</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>On the question of the &ldquo;finality&rdquo; of religion, see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Burkert1998Creation">Burkert 1998</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]</ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="7.2">7.2 Table of Topics</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="7.2"></ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="7.3">7.3 Transitivity and Not</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="7.3">        <li><p>A common idea (for instance in <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Bettini2014Polytheism">Bettini 2014</a>) holds that polytheism is more tolerant and less violent than monotheism. However, the two different religious views cannot be compared &ldquo;straight across&rdquo; and used for their civil effects. They differ at the level of grammatical structure, as it were, between transitive and intransitive verbs</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>The &laquo;I-Thou&raquo; relation happens in the present and is &laquo;continually present and enduring&raquo; (p. 13). It is not &laquo;cut off and hardened&raquo;, like objects that can be relegated to the past or to locations in space. It only lives in the present instant. Along similar lines, Buccellati contrasts the &laquo;<strong>diffuse transcendence</strong> proper to polytheism&raquo; with the &laquo;<strong>absolute transcendence</strong> of the one God&raquo;, who is perceived as &laquo;situated above the temporal flux precisely in recognizing that his ‘grace’ (<em>hen</em> in Hebrew, which is to say his providential interest in the affairs of the world) remains unchanged in every case, regardless of whatever calamities afflict the social group that recognizes him.&raquo; (<em>When</em> 7.3). Buber and Buccellati also agree in their perception of the instability of the &laquo;I-Thou&raquo; relationship. For Buber, &laquo;it is the exalted melancholy of our fate, that every Thou in our world must become an It. … As soon as the relation has been worked out or has been permeated with a means, the Thou becomes an object among objects—perhaps the chief, but still one of them, fixed in its size and its limits.&raquo; (p. 16-17) Man longs for control and extension in time. &laquo;Thus God becomes an object of faith. At first faith, set in time, completes the acts of relation; but gradually it replaces them.&raquo; (p. 113) </p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, April 2020</p>]</ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="7.4">7.4 Intuition and Revelation</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="7.4">        <li><p>Whether or not there is a &ldquo;touching presence&rdquo; (God) who reveals himself, the hidden reality (the &ldquo;toucher&rdquo;) can only be accessed through human perception (the &ldquo;touched&rdquo;). Clarity on this point aids in avoiding sterile arguments that affirm or deny certainty about the nature and character of the &ldquo;touching presence&rdquo;, and redirects attention to the historial data that are undeniable. See Faivre&rsquo;s critique of Eliad, and Buccellati&rsquo;s alternative proposal: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Faivre1995">Faivre 1995</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]</ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="7.5">7.5 Evolutionary Patterns</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="7.5">        <li><p>It is interesting that Buber’s first translator in English, Ronald Gregor Smith, insisted on a progressive movement from an &laquo;old monistic&raquo; manner of thought to the two-fold interpretation of experience that Buber presents. Buber, on the other hand, states that there is no progress, and that the apperception of the Thou is an event that inevitably tends toward a decline into an It relationship. &laquo;Man is twofold&raquo; means that man cannot live only in the utter present of the Thou, but also must live in the world of things. The old Plato vs. Aristotle debate, summarized in Raffael’s <em>stanze vaticane</em>, remains an inescapable <strong>duality</strong>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, April 2020</p>]        <li><p>Original authentic experience tends to be codified and crystallized in time. The resulting &ldquo;bigotry&rdquo; must be distinguished from the original experience, whether one is observing this spiritual dynamic in Mesopotamia or in Biblical religion. Furthermore, a value in purely external religious rites can be discerned. See: (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Cicero0045Deorum">Cicero 0045</a>). </p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, April 2020</p>]</ol>
