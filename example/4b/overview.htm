&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website serves as a programmatic introductory <i><b>hub to the cluster</b></i> of six websites listed on the <a href="../4banks-index.htm">home page</a>.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 1. <i><b>CONCEPTS</b></i> provides a brief review of the major theoretical issues which the cluster aims to bring into focus, in particular with regard to the nature of digitality and the view of a website as a structural whole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 2. <i><b>COROLLARIES</b></i> develops some points that relate to some particular theoretical aspects of the project.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 3 deals with the <i><b>SUBSTANTIVE</b></i> aim of the project, describing how the websites can be used as tools for bibliographical research.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 4 deals, analogously, with <i><b>METHODOLOGICAL</b></i> aim of the project, showing how the various components of the websites implement concretely the notion of <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, which is the primary methodological goal of the cluster.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 5. <i><b>THE RECORD</b></i> contains the bibliographical data that are related to theoretical issues taken up in this programmatic website.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 6. <i><b>MECHANISMS</b></i> presents the infrastructure that is in place to keep the system functioning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left handside bar gives the site map, and serves as a Table of Contents that provides the reader, at all times, with a sense of the internal unity and structure of the digital discourse as developed within the website.<br>
