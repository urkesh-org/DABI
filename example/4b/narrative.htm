<h3>The narrative thread</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital narratives are <i><b>threads presenting a linear argument dynamically linked to external elements</b></i>. As schematically shown in Figure 1, a given narrative A unfolds the argument through successive steps a, b,c, etc., and for any given step (such as c or d) it draws on a concurrent argument presented in a parallel narrative, and it draws ss well (as in step f) on data that are found in a similarly concurrent database.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formalization I use proposes <i><b>a SEGMENTED narrative, with emphasis on "segmented."</b></i> Each segment (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, etc.) corresponds to a short section defined by a title (as with the title "Narrative" for this section), which is further subdivided into short paragraphs, each with higlighted keywords. There is <a href="thought.htm#discourse">no categorization system</a> that defines parameters for these sections or paragraphs, so their various correlations are activated by hyperlinks and by the studying of the website. On the other hand, sections and paragraphs are intentionally short, so that each incorporates a single central idea. What makes the digital narratives a part of the digital discourse is the fact that the narratives are natively constructed as being parallel, and can be expected to be so (i. e., parallel) by the reader.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is at the same time a <i><b>segmented NARRATIVE, with emphasis on "narrative"</b></i> with its own coherent flow. This is indicated graphically by the arrows that define both the directionality of the argument and the sequential correlation of the segments: <b>b</b> makes sense because it comes after <b>a</b> and before <b>c</b>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 4banks websites, <i><b>multiple narratives</b></i> are found in Part I,  the <a href="structure.htm#configuration">A<small>RGUMENT</small> section</a>, and they engage digitally with each other as discussed in the section on <a href="discourse structure.htm">digital discourse</a>. While each narrative is unilinear in an of itself, it invokes multilinearity and depends on it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One limitation in the first version of the websites is that the core narrative is in fact represented by a <i><b>non-digital narrative</b></i>, a printed book. This is due to the the nature of the formation process through which the <a href="history-p.htm#early">project has matured</a>; in <a href="archives.htm">subsequent versions</a>, the core narrative will be fully digital.<br></mark>

<h3>Browser edition</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A narrative website is a text formatted as a <i><b>browser edition</b></i>: it is conceived as natively digital, and is not a printed text that has been digitized, whether as a photographic image or as a searchable text.<br>

<h3>Para-digital</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In current parlance, the term "digital" is used in ways that reflect only in part the modalities here outlined. Of particular interest to us is the digital transfer of a paper publication in a .PDF format. This is indeed <i><b>digital in the technical sense</b></i> that it relies on the translation of the paper format into digits that can be assembled by the computer for a display practially identical to that of the paper version. As a result there is also the advantage of searchability which is missing in the analog dimension.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the <i><b>other aspects of a digital dimension are missing</b></i>, and to emphasize this difference I use the term "para-digital," in a way that is similar to that which one find, for instance, in the term "para-medic" as opposed to a properly medical doctor.<br>
