<h3>Two modalities</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same <a href="structure.htm">website structure</a> can be accessed in either a whole oriented modality or a fragment oriented modality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two modalities parallel each other closely, but with different <a href="#modalities">aspects</a>. There is, we may say, a <i><b>bimodal dimension</b></i>, in the sense that the data as presented in the websites are designed so as to be accessed in parallel ways depending on the intent with which one approaches them. In other words, each website is so structured as to serve the our stated <a href="aims.htm">aims</a> (substantive and methodological) in ways that are consonant but distinct.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i><b>whole oriented modality</b></i>, the reader confronts a closed whole, wherein the argument and the data are laid out in static juxtaposition, with the argument flowing in a unilinear path. Is is the modality well establihed in scholarship, whereby the material is physically embodied in a paper publication, which may also appear in an equivalent <a href="#para-digital">para-digital</a> format (typically .PDF).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <i><b>fragment oriented modality</b></i>, on the other hand, the reader confronts an open aggregate, wherein the argument and the data are dynamically interacting along multilinear paths that can be accessed concurrently. I view websites as the digital correlatives of paper publications, and the 4Banks websites aim at implementing this approach. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two modalities share the same conceptual orientation, and are to be seen <i><b>not in opposition to each other</b></i>, but rather in a relationhsip of reciprocal <a href="discourse.htm#synergy">synergy</a>.<br>

<h3>Four aspects</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two modalities are characterized by four aspects: continuity, contiguity, connectivity and sequentiality. They are realized differentially for each modality as shown in the following diagram, and as detailed further in the paragraphs that follow.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Modalities:fragment and whole</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>1. Contiguity: compact vs. aggregate</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a whole oriented modality, the data are seen as tightly contiguous with each other. We tend to look at the argument <i><b>in its integrity as a whole</b></i>, which also follows from the modality of continuity: the perception of the whole is possible because the structure is closed. A telltale sign of the system is that we can see the resulting product "from cover to cover," which applies also to a .PDF version.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fragment oriented modality, the data are seen as an <i><b>aggregate of disparate elements</b></i> rather than as a whole, and we tend to see the argument in this light, as nothing more than the sum of its parts. The positional dimension of each element is constitutive of its identity. See also under <a href="discourse.htm#whole">digital discourse</a>.<br>
<br>

<h3>2. Continuity: closed vs. open</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a whole oriented modality, the data are seen as a continuum, not only formally (as on a printed page), but also conceptually. The flow of the argument takes place <i><b>within the bounds of this continuum</b></i>, and both writer and reader are encased, as it were, within it. In this sense, the system is closed, tightly packed: the succession of steps that form the argument is self-contained, what can be added can only come from the outside of the finished product. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fragment oriented modality, on the other hand, the data are both continuous and not: there is a succession of the elements of the argument, but the steps in the flow are seen primarily  as such, i. e., as <i><b>steps which derive their continuity from being juxtaposed</b></i>, but remain essentially isolated. It is for this reason that quantification is the hallmark of the digital approach: the fragments are so structured that they can be seen in and by themselves.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Modalities:fragment and whole</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>3. Connectivity: static vs. dynamic</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential characteristics of critical judgment consists in bracing the disparate elements within the continuum of the argument flow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a whole oriented modality, connectivity among data is potential, hence static. As a result, <i><b>the bracing happens in the mind of the reader</b></i>, who can "jump" back and forth, as well as outside of, the argument flow, on the strength of his or her own knowledge. The elements of the argument, the moments in its flow, as well as the data on which it is based, are there to be seen; but they are juxtaposed statically.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fragment oriented modality, instead, <i><b>bracing is inherent in the very structural make-up of the data</b></i>. Connectivity among the moments of the argument flow, as well as the data on which the argument rests, is built into these elements, moments and data, which are thus linked <a href="thought.htm#critical">dynamically</a> with each other.<br>
<br>

<a name=sequentiality></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Modalities:fragment and whole</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>4. Sequentiality: unilinear vs. multilinear</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unilinear argument, as found in the whole oriented modality, follows <i><b>a single thread</b></i>. On a printed page, footnotes point to parallel threads, without however following them in their entirety. There are also parallel threads that are developed more explicitly, in the form of excursuses and appendices. But these are generally limited in scope, and more difficult to see concurrently with the main thread of the central argument. Sequentiality is thus tightly tied to the flow of the argument.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multilinear approach instead, as found in the fragment oriented modality, is so structured as to propose <i><b>concurrent threads</b></i> that run simultaneously. Footnotes do not properly exist because they are raised to the level of the primary argument, and so are excursuses and appendices. We have a multi-tiered construct where a single argument flows along synchronous tracks, as if producing a harmony out of distinct, but consonant contributing elements.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must stress the difference with regard to the current view that juxtaposes <i><b>linear vs. non-linear</b></i>, which I discuss in the section on the <a href="uses.htm#deeps">uses of the system</a>. <br>

<h3>Websites</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a printed book, monograph or article is the primary vehicle for publishing a whole oriented modality, a website may be seen as the primary vehicle for publishing a fragment oriented modality. For the advantages and limitations that a website entails see the section on the <a href="medium.htm">digital medium</a>.<br>

<a name=complementarity></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Modalities:fragment and whole</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Complementarity</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two  modalities, whole and fragment oriented, are <i><b>not mutually exclusive</b></i> and in opposition to each other, as if the fragment oriented were expected to supersede the analogical. Rather, the two are to be seen as concurrent, on the basis of a productive complementarity. Let us think of it in terms of the <a href="#attributes">four modalities</a>: continuity, contiguity, connectivity, sequentiality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Continuity and contiguity</b></i>. &#8211; In the whole oriented modality, the object of interest is seen as a closed whole: it speaks to us in its totality and it invokes our taking a stand in front of this totality, in other words, it elicits experience. It is closer to the humanistic aim at appropriating a living past. &#8211; An open aggregate, on the other hand, encourages distance, since it is dissected for us to examine: it is directly in line with the <i>epoch&egrave;</i> of the social sciences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Connectivity and sequentiality</b></i>. &#8211; In the whole oriented modality, the static view encourages reflection, through a certain distance from the observed: one focuses on the individual moments in the unilinear flow of the argument, even at the cost of keeping in the background the potential bracing with other pertinent moments. &#8211; A dynamic view, on the other hand, encourages bracing, by presenting potential comparables within the parallel threads present in a multilinear organization of the data, even at the cost of glossing over details.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, the whole and fragment oriented modalities come together structurally, through an active <a href="synergy.htm">synergy</a> which blends together the bimodal modality into a new epistemological system.<br>
<br>

<a name=analogies></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Modalities:fragment and whole</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Analogies</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between whole and fragment oriented modalities appears in a number of different realizations, and it may be usefuf to point to some of them in relation to the four sets of attributes I have described.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>1. Continuity</b></i>. &#8211; We may think of an analog clock face: the face is the whole and the hands two gradients that can be understood only in relationship to the whole. &#8211; A digital clock, on the other hand, shows the time numerically, independent of the whole to which it refers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>2. Contiguity</b></i>. &#8211; An analog thermometer consists of an element, such as mercury, which expands in correspondence to the temperature with which it is in contact: continuity is here found in the way in which the element, mercury, expands, and the measure is set through a preordained gauge. &#8211; On the other end, we may think of a digital picture, which is made up of individual pixels that can be identified as such, as when we speak of the DPI (dots per inch) factor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>3. Connectivity</b></i>. &#8211; We may think of the difference between looking at the picture of a landscape and actually driving through it. The picture will evoke memories of other pictures, which may be produced to favor a critical confrontation: the picture in itself is static, and the dynamics of the comparison is introduced by the observer. &#8211; The drive through, on the other hand, is dynamic by its very nature: it unfolds a series of views,  which correspond to the pictures one could view statically, except that here they move of their own accord in and out of the perceptual range of the observer, presenting built-in comparisons as one moves forward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>4. Sequentiality</b></i>. &#8211; We may think of a song, where the melody flows carried by a single voice. We may focus on the tune or the lyrics, we may reproduce the melody on an instrument, we may consider isolated segments but the fundamental sequentiality of the single human voice remains essentially unilinear in its structure. &#8211; On the other end, we may think of a symphony or better yet of a concerto for orchestra and a solo instrument, where parallel registers flow along together within the compass of a single unified score. We may say that a properly digital text is structured along the lines of a conceptual harmony that emulates that of an orchestral ensemble.<br>

<h3>Perspectives</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the first aim (a comprehensive bibliographical support<!--  for <a href="../4banks-index.htm">six aspects</a> of cultural history as they relate to ancient Mesopotamia. , one will find in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> a discursive approach to these topics, and in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small> a set of data in a form that is consonant with a standard annotated bibliography.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the second, methodological, aim, I intend to show how a browser based approach, as available in a website, provides a good tool for combining a data set with an argument based narrative. This is achieved by interlacing the sequential texts as given in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> with the data found in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small>, and viceversa.<br>
