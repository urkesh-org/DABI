<h3>The notion of website</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I focus on the notion of a website as <i><b>a literary construct and an epistemological instrument</b></i>, i. e., a channel for structruing and conveying knowledge. It is an ideal vehicle to this end, first and foremost because it allows us to combine the <a href="systems.htm">two systems</a>, relating to data and narrative, into a unified argument, in ways that are not possible in a paper format. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Websites are so ubiquitous nowadays that it may seem pointless ot <i><b>inquire about their nature and structure</b></i>. But too facile an acceptance of what a website purports to be has led, in my view, to an underappreciation of its potential for scholarly communication. The present discussion is intended to bear this out. As indicated, I aim to show how a website can be a literary construct and serve as an epistemological locus. On the one hand this task may seem unnecessary &#8211; on the grounds that the nature and purpose of a website are obvious. On the other, the same task may seem futile &#8211; on the grounds that there is not sufficient substance to warrant such an effort.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justify my view, we will look critically into a website's nature and structure. In principle, this analysis obtains for any and all websites. In fact, the major points raised here, concerning their literary and epistemological dimension, are <i><b>present only potentially or embryonically in standard current websites</b></i>. To illustrate this point, we should distinguish between two basic types of websites, one which serves exclusively as a container and another that includes a discourse function within the container.<br> -->

<h3>Digital container and digital discourse</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the two types of website is conditioned by two major factors: the nature of the boundaries and the nature of the interlacing.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Websites</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>The nature of the boundaries of the website</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in the container type website, the boundaries of the container are determined from the outside, by the nature of the container, not by the coherence of the whole inside;</li>
  <li>in a discourse type website, by contrast, the boundaries are determined by the coherence of the whole:</li>

<h3>The nature of the interlacing with other layers</h3>

<ul>
    <li>in the container type website, interlacing among layers is at the level of the segment, not of the layers qua layers;</li>
  <li>in the discourse type, by cnotrast, interlacing is between whole layers qua layers, and it is reciprocal:</li>
</ul>

<mark>there is dynammics in container, but it is anecdotal -- see slides about urkesh > sumerians > neolithic<br>
give chart with curving hyperlink<br>
look at hyperlinks under <a href="structure.htm">structure</a><br>
</mark><br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>see also undre <a href="narrative.htm#browser">narrative</a><br>
The <i><b>structural distinctiveness of a browser edition</b></i> as implemented in our websites lies in the way in which multiple narratives and multiple data sets are constructed in parallel, so as to complement each other systemically. The full argument emerges only from the dynamic concurrence of these many layers, and depends on all of them at once. This full argument is what I call a <a href="discourse.htm">digital discour</mark>se</a>. <br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will illustrate the traits of the website understood as digital sicourse in juxtaposition with those of the website understood as a digital container<br>

<h3>Configuration: surface structure</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of surface structure refers to <i><b>the <a href="configuration.htm">formal configuration</a> that a website takes:</b></i> it is the concrete and tangible form in which it is displayed on the screen, but seen from a conceptual point of view. It is not the aesthetic aspect that is of concern here, but rather the proportional weight of the various components as they affect our perception of the website seen as a coherent whole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration of a website deals with the way in which<i><b> the display is organized and accessed as an epistemological channel</b></i>. In other words, what is at stake is the way in which knowledge is conceived and presented so as to make its communication clear and effective.<br>

<h3>Frame: deep structure</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of deep structure refers to the way in which multiple formal layers are interlaced with each other. I use the notion of "frame" to refer to the nature of this <br>
stratifed<br>
different from multi-tasking: layers are interlaced, co-present, converging, whereas in multi-tasking they are juxtaposed<br>
 It is a complex task, which I subsume under the concept of <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>. It requires special attention and care, both in <a href="uses.htm">writing and reading</a> a website, and once implemented it discloses the full potential of a website in light of the goal I am aiming for, i. e., the website as an indeal epistemological channel.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is especially in the case of deep structure that <i><b>current websites fail to realize the full potential of the medium</b></i>. The reason is that, while <a href="hyperlinks.htm#conceptual">hyperlinks</a> do effectively and efficiently interlace layers (i. e., the various pages and websites on which they call), they do not see the layers qua layers: the hyperlinks are rather anecdotal, in the sense that they draw on information whose meaning is exhausted in the fragment. It is a segmented, rather than a systemic interlacing.<br> -->
