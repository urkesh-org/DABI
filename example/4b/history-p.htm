<h3>Introduction</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>4Banks</i> project has gone through a <i><b>long developmental process</b></i>, which was conditioned by the a number of concurrent factors, such as the innovations in hard- and software, the growth of interests in my own personal research, and most of all the maturation on my part of a critical reflection about digital methods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/intro/history.htm">Critique</a> website contains a detailed history of the process relating to the archaeological dimension. Here I will sketch more summarily the overall progress of the project, which spans by now a full half a century.<br>

<h3>Phase 1. Pre-digital: <i>Akkadian Grammatical Studies</i> (1970-96)</h3>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working on <a href="http://www.giorgiobuccellati.net/abstracts/abstr.htm#1996grammar" target=blank><i> A Structural Grammar of Babylonian</i></a>, I began to compile<i><b> a systematic bibliography</b></i> that aimed to cover the full range of studies going back to the earliest phases of the research. In the <a href="http://urkesh.org/EL2/Buccellati_1996_A_Structural_Grammar_of_Babylonian.pdf#page=7" target=blank>preface (p. x)</a> I described what I envisaged would appear as a separate volume, entitled <i>A Critical Review of Akkadian Grammatical Studies</i>. I had in fact worked on this in the 1970'es and 80'es, but I did not finish preparing the volume for publication. Part of the reason was that, by the time the <i>Grammar</i> was published in 1996, I had begun to explore possibilities of publishing the <i>Critical Review</i> in digital format, even though it was not clear at that point what format this would take, much less that it would be possible to offer it online 
 &#8211; as is finally becoming possible with the website <a href="https://4banks.net/Akk-lg/akk-lg.htm">Akk-lg.net</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work on the projected <i>Critical Review</i> was important in two respects.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Conceptually, it stimulated my thinking on how to make the data available in ways that might be <i><b>more flexible than through the printed pag</b></i>e, opening the way for the whole methodological approach that underlies the <i>4Banks</i> approach.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Substantively, it provided the initial core for the current version of <a href="https://4banks.net/Akk-lg/akk-lg.htm">Akk-lg.net</a>, with some three hundred bibliographical entries and portions of the introductory chapters. It also laid the groundwork for the effort at going back to the earliest phases in the development of the discipline, and thus to arrive at an understanding, beyond the documentary information, of <i><b>the growth of awareness that conditions our approach today</b></i> as it did from the beginning that of the earlier scholars.<br>

<h3>Phase 2. Early digital: <i>Companion websites</i> (2000-13)</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Akkadian Grammatical Studies</i> project lay dormant after publication of the <i>Structural Grammar of Babylonian</i>, but <i><b>the idea of a bibliographical "companion"</b></i> came up again as I began prepariong for publication volumes on other aspects of Mesopotamian civilization. The first two were on religion and politics. They appeared respectively in 2012 as <a href="https://www.jacabook.com/non-fiction/history/155-when-the-skies-above.html" target=blank><i>&#171;Quando in alto i cieli...&#187; La spiritualit&agrave; mesopotamica a confronto con quella biblica</i></a> (to appear in English and Spanish in 2021) and in 2013 as <a href="https://www.jacabook.com/non-fiction/history/154-at-the-origin-of-politics.html" target=blank><i>Alle origini della politica. La formazione e la crescita dello stato in Siro-Mesopotamia</i></a> (to appear in English in 2022).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I resumed the idea of a bibliographical companion, which by now had <i><b>come to be clearly defined as a website</b></i>, and I again so indicated in the preface to each of the two volumes. In the religion volume (p. XXIII) I wrote: "I do not offer any documentation here. The reader can find it instead online at <a href="http://www.giorgiobuccellati.net/info.htm" target=blank>www.giorgiobuccellati.net</a>. Besides bibliographic references and an evaluation of some of the current strands of critical analysis, especially with those that most diverge from my own analysis, there are also thematic explorations in a more technical style, notes to the various chapters, and excurses on related subjects."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the volume on politics I wrote (p. XXVI): "Really meant as an essay on political institutions, this volume does not intend to offer a systematic presentation of the relative facts of the political and cultural history of Mesopotamia, although obviously it follows its outline. I refer to the essential facts for a comprehension of the arguments in an indicative and selective way but without giving either documentation or bibliographic support. For this purpose, <i><b>I link to a particular section of my personal website</b></i>, <a href="http://www.giorgiobuccellati.net/info.htm" target=blank>www.giorgiobuccellati.net</a>, a section which I am developing and will be open to the public in the future."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the <i>Akkadian Grammatical Studies</i>, so for these two volumes as well, <i><b>the promise is fulfilled now</b></i> with the respective websites within the <i>4Banks</i> project. In the intervening time I have indeed worked on these websites, and they are all the richer now as a consequence. The <a href="http://www.mes-rel.net" target=blank>website on religion</a> will open in early 2021, in conjunction with the publication of the English and Spanish version of the corresponding volume. Work is progressing on the <a href="https://4banks.net/Akk-lg/akk-lg.htm" target=blank>language</a> and <a href="http://www.mes-pol.net" target=blank>politics</a> websites, and they are expected to open in late 2021.<br>

<h3>Phase 3. Structuring: <i>Critique</i> (2015-17)</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first website to actually open was <a href="https://www.critique-of-AR.net" target=blank><i>critique-of-AR.net</i></a>, in 2017. It was the first to achieve an adequate internal coherence and this<br>
