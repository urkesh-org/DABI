<h3>The concept</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of digital discourse is at the heart of the methodological effort of the 4banks cluster of websites: it refers to the <i><b>frame wherein multiple narratives and multiple data sets are dynamically interconnected</b></i>. The notion of "frame" is particularly significant because it provides a self-imposed limit to what would otherwise remain too loose an aggregate of parts. The narratives and data sets are not juxtaposed at random, they are created concurrently (<a href="uses.htm#writing">writing</a>) and are meant to be so accessed (<a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a>).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also say that the digital discourse is a <i><b>compositional array </b></i>that holds the parts together by identifying ("framing") their reciprocal relationships. In this sense, a digital discourse entails a dynamic interaction among the constitutive parts of the "discourse," dynamic in the sense that the interaction is initiated within the discourse itself, and it invokes a new kind of human attention(<a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a>). It requires a quantum leap in the posture vis-&agrave;-vis communication, one that is similar to what obtained when writing first came on the scene in human history.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dynamism" means, in this case, that <i><b>the parts "discourse" digitally with each other</b></i>, taking the verb "to discourse" in its active sense. A hyperlink is not an anectodal and casual addition, but an integral and essential interlocutor. The parts dialog with each other, and it is the coherence of the whole that gives value to the individual components, as with the tesserae of a mosaic.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, each hyperlink (the tessera) can so "dialog" with the others <i><b>only if it is seen as a component of the larger whole</b></i> (the mosaic) within which it is organically encased. Through one of its individual components, it is a whole that is "discoursing" with other wholes. It is not a dialog between single elements.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is then an ambitious undertaking, one that requires a new level of commitment to <i><b>the process through which scholarship is  constructed and communicated</b></i>. The full argument which the digital discourse unfolds rests in fact on this extreme multiplicity of layers, and depends on the development of a new kind of <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a> and of a special new posture in <a href="uses.htm">writing, reading and studying</a>.<br>

<a name=fluidity></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital discourse</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Fluidity</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, when we access a website <i><b>we "surf" and "browse"</b></i> &#8211; both terms describing an approach to the surface: we skim the surface on a wave that carries us of its own accord; we nibble the buds, biting at what is in immediate evidence, and passing on quickly to the next appealing bite.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only the we stay at the surface, but that <i><b>the surface effectively carries us</b></i>: surfing implies that the wave moves with us poised on it in a balancing act, and browsing implies that we are in constant motion as we graze going from morsel to morsel.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first blush, such motility has a <i><b>negative connotation</b></i> &#8211; and it is a fact that it can influence very adversely our inclination, and ultimately our ability, to reach deeper. We see this in the youngsters who are developing a growing dependence on the web &#8211; but in fact even among adults the habit is having an impact that is going beyond the mere use of the medium, to where it impacts mental and even psychological attitudes.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If seen, however, within the purview of digital discourse, <i><b>such fluidity is the hallmark of a deeper value, for it leads to a firm apprehension of the whole</b></i>. This is in direct correlation with the nature of a digital discourse as an organically structured construct. How does it work?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the layers on which a given digital discourse are explicitly declared; if, in other words, there is indeed a multi-layered structure of the type shown in the <a href="discourse.htm#structure">graph</a> and if it is made explicit; then the very fluidity of the medium makes it possible to obtain <i><b>a sense of the organic unity that holds the structure together</b></i>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not in the current standards to create websites with such organically structured unity, and that is why we do not expect a website to be in the shape of a digital discourse. <i><b>Fluidity remains then just a trampoline that makes a permanent vagary possible</b></i>. To the extent that we implement the in our websites, particularly in the scholarly websites, an architecture based on a structured digital discourse we can begins to expect an equivalent structural change in our production and use of the medium.<br>

<a name=juxtaposition></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>>Epistemological system(s): argument</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Argument and data: juxtaposition</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest <i><b>approximation to an integration of argument and data</b></i> is generally in the form of a digital version of a set linear text, typically a .PDF. The digital dimension of the text lies in two factors, not found in a paper edition: (1) a search function, and (2) the availability of hyperlinks. These do expand the dynamics inhernet in the text, but dos not properly contribute to the argument as such. The approximation results only in a hybrid system, still heavily weighted on the side of the data.<br>
<br>

<a name=integration></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>>Epistemological system(s): argument</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Argument and data: integration</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go beyond the approximation and to achieve proper integration, the argument needs to blend digitally with the data, within a single whole. The approach I follow to achieve this goal within the context of 4banks.net is in the form of a <i><b>browser edition</b></i>, which is typically housed in a website. A browser allows the creation of a proper <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, which is an effective way of blending narrative and sources.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital discourse is thus one solution in the effort to <i><b>heal the <a href="#split">epistemological split</a></b></i>: it offers a way to implement a properly digital argument that interacts directly with the digital data base, going beyond the hybrid dimension offered by a .PDF text. The two (data and argument) are not juxtaposed, as in a hybrid system, but are instead truly "integrated," i. e., they constitute a new system of constructing and communicating knowledge.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With digital discourse we create a <i><b>third epistemological system</b></i>, one that does justice to the full power of the digital medium and shows at the same time the deeper impact of <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a>.<br>

<a name=linearity></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Epistemological system(s): narrative</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Linearity</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>An argument rests on a narrative thread</b></i> that builds progressively, resting on basic shared presuppositions, advancing evidence from facts, drawing conclusions from stated inferences. A narrative is thus intrinsically a linear process, because one step presupposes another and serves in turn as a presupposition for the next &#8211; but this requires a clarification.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Narrative linearity is not purely vectorial</b></i>, by which I mean that it is not going blindly in a forward direction. In a narrative thread, linear progression carries with it the awareness of the whole whithin which it moves. This conditions the process in a fundamental way: the progress from data to inference is always in function of the larger whole, which must be kept in mind at all times. That is why <a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a> cannot be blindly vectorial, much less leapfrogging. It requires going back to the thread in the measure in which one absorbs the sense of the structure of the whole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>The epistemological dimension of a narrative argument</b></i> is clear: it elaborates on the known in order to expand it. As such it is <br>

<h3>The Urkesh Global Record</h3>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4banks cluster of websites implements a relatively limited version of the concept of digital discourse. One will find a more complex, and complete, implementation in <a href="http://www.urkesh.org/record" target=blank>urkesh.org</a>, a website I have created for the Mozan/Urkesh Archaeological Project. This website applies more fully the methodological and philosophical principles presented in <a href="http://www.critique-of-AR.net/book" target=blank><i>A Critique of Archaeological Reason</i></a>.<br>
