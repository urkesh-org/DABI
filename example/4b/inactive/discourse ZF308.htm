<h3>The concept</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of digital discourse is at the heart of the methodological effort of the 4banks cluster of websites: it refers to the <i><b>frame within which argument and data are encased</b></i>. The notion of "frame" is particularly significant because it provides a self-imposed limit to what would otherwise remain too loose an aggregate of parts. A frame is a conceptual entity: it is a compositional array that holds the parts together by identifying ("framing") their reciprocal relationships.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Tensionality</b></i> is an essential factor of discourse in general, and of digital discourse in particular. As a simple example of what tensionality means, we may think of the rhyme in a metrically construed poem: the rhyme comes to life only if there is a larger composition (the poem), where the flow of the verses is punctuated by repeated phonic patterns. Clearly, a single verse, or scattered lines of text that do not follow a pattern, do not qualify, even if the phonic repetition were to occur. It is such patterned recurrence that creates tensionality.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that one does not have a sense of tensionality if one does not have <i><b>a perception of the compositional whole</b></i> within which the tensionality may occur: in this regard, and somewhat ironically, no matter how many hyperlinks exist in a digital text, they do not evoke tensionality, but rather diffuse it, because they lead to a target that is only minimally expected (we know there is target and we expect to get there, but its connection to the larger composition is missing because there is no such compositional whole in the first place). In other words, the individual threads emerge as dominant, and the frame serves only as a container<br>

<h3>Whole vs. aggregate</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between whole and aggregate is important. It is the <a href="https://4banks.net/4b/structures.htm#contiguity">first attribute (contiguity)</a> that distinguishes the analog and the digital modalities, and, as such, it seems to <i><b>exclude the possibility, for an analog modality, to deal with a whole</b></i>: it deals in fact, by definition, with aggregates seen as composites of parts. Let us consider the example of a digital data base: here the frame corresponds to the matrix that defines the cells to be used; it is, in other words, a composite that acquires sense from being accessible in its component parts, the cells. This happens within clearly defined boundaries, for sure, but the matrix remains intrinsically open for an unlimited number of data that can fill these cells. Similarly, with a website there is a site map that outlines the contents, or more simply the top or side bars that provide direction and thus indicate how to access the information: but this remains hidden, and can again be increased or removed at will.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, in either case (data base and website), the frame is known, there is no practical limit to how expansive the content can be. This has of course major advantages, in that it allows one to expand freely the data that are marshaled in support of the argument, and to expand as well the argument by including unending parallel narratives. But <i><b>precisely because of this expansiveness, digitality is structurally unsuited for the whole</b></i>. It does, of course, bring into play the totality of the parts: but it is seen, precisely, as a sum that coincides with the parts, not as a sum that is greater than the parts.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to look at this is to think in terms of <i><b>perception</b></i>. While we have at best a perception of the matrix of a data base or of a website, we do not have a perception of its contents. This is in the very nature of things: with a printed chart we gain immediately a sense of its contents, however many pages it may occupy (unlike what happens with a digital data base); and with a book, however voluminous, we gain immediately a sense of its contents, even apart from looking at its table of contents (unlike what happens with a website).<br>

<h3>Synergy</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of  perception with regard to the whole goes to the root of a larger problem. Online publications appear as ephemeral not only because of issues intrinsic to the <a href="https://4banks.net/4b/medium.htm">medium</a>, but also, and more deeply, because, as a result of being mere aggregates, they <i><b>do not have a suitable conceptual configuration</b></i>, suitable, that is, to qualify as proper publications. The solution to the problem lies in letting a synergy between the two modalities play its full role: it is through such synergy that the aporia is overcome.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful, in this regard, to consider the <i><b>intuitive sense of structure</b></i> which emerged from the beginning as a fundamental trait of human nature. Even in the pre-logical and pre-linguistic phases of our species, in the farthest reaches of the Paleolithic, we can infer the existence of such a sense of structure &#8211; it is the one that made progress possible, however infinitesimaly slow such progress may have been for the first two million years. The analog modality capitalizes on this intuitive sense of structure: the compositional whole is physically visible in the printed format, it lends itself fully to the perception of the reader.<br>
<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my aim is to have digital discourse assert <i><b>the same sense of structure within the digital modality</b></i>. To do so, the discourse must be conceived as such, as a discourse, with a well defined frame that allows for tensionality within itself. The websites of this cluster are constructed with this in mind, as shown concretely, with regard to the websites in this cluster, in Part 4 under <a href="d-frame.htm">frame</a> and <a href="d-multilinearity.htm">multilinearity</a>.<br><br> -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A synergy between the two modalities allows <i><b>digital discourse to mutuate this sense of structure from the analog modality</b></i> and apply it to the digital modality.This does not result in a hybrid system, but rather in a real synergy between analog and digital modalities, one that heals the <a href="systems.htm#integration">epistemological split</a> and creates in effect a new epistemological system of constructing (<a href="uses.htm#writing">writing</a>) and communicating (<a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a>) knowledge, a system based on the notion of digital discourse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, while digitality is, in and of itself, concerned with aggregates, these aggregates can in fact also be viewed as wholes. To see how this can happen, we should consider three factors. (1) <i><b>Temporally</b></i>, one should look for a moment when the process achieves closure. (2) <i><b>Conceptually</b></i>, the synergy points in the direction of the underlying wholeness and invokes from within an <a href="#conclusion">explicit definition</a> of the digital discourse. (3) <i><b>Bibliographically</b></i>, it calls for an analogous definition of a <a href="#status">firm status</a> that may lend stability from without to the same digital discourse.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital discourse</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>1. Closure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closure is the <i><b>temporal correlative of wholeness</b></i>: this refers to the moment when, in the eyes of the author, a publication can be considered complete. At this juncture, the "publication" is "published," i.e., it goes beyond the private sphere and is consigned to the public.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current use of websites, this moment is typically <i><b>deferred indefinitely</b></i>, or rather, it is not even considered as a real, desirable possibililty. Websites are considered to be by nature in constant flux: the fact that they are constantly being brought up to date is attractive, but it is at the same time very problematic. Such fluidity is possible only because one gives up on the notion of wholeness: chameleon-like, a website is never expected to be the same. It is, therefore, never expected to be whole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear awareness of this problem, but the solution that is generally adopted compounds the problem, instead of solving it: it is htat of citing <i><b>the date when a website has been accessed</b></i>. This compounds the problem because it consecrates it: we accept as final the lack of finality. How counterproductive this solution is, is clear form the fact that the assignation of a date of access does in no way "publish" the website in question: in most cases, it is not there to be verified any longer, and the semblance of publication is entirely entrusted to its citation &#8211; which in most cases does not quote the text, but simply refers to it indirectly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real solution is to look for, to recognize and to declare a given moment of closure, and thus to <i><b>consign to the public the current result, in its perceived wholeness</b></i>. This is how we can properly achieve a "publication" status. At the root of the problem is that one does not typically seek to establish a digital discourse in the first place, and for tyhis reason the notion that one should look for wholeness seems to beg the question.<br>

<h3>2. Explicit definition of wholeness</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given closure, one should then reflect on what it means<br>


If the explicit recognigtion of the importantce of providing a firm and stable <a href="#status">bibligraphical status</a> addresses the issue of an <i><b>explicit definition of wholeness</b></i> from without, the implementation of a proper digital discourse provides and answer from within, by aiming to a conceptual answer to the problem. As a specific <br>
The generally accepted unsuitability of a website for a <a href="conclusion.htm">conclusion</a> is indicative of the problem, and it suggests at the same time a solution.<br>


is one further indication of this: we cannot imagine a concluding reflection for a website because it is not, structurally, amenable to a perception of what it may be as a whole. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A discourse offers a broader scope within which tensionality obtains. It is this tensionality that creates suspense in a novel, where one expects a final "denouement," or in a complex logical argument where one expects a final point of arrival. A <i><b>conclusion</b></i>, which we normally expect in an analog publication, is not expected, and is never found, in a digital publication such as a website. And that is because there is no proper digital discourse behind a standard website.<br>

<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of frame is helpful in helping us further define the <i><b>difference between an aggregate and a whole</b></i>. &#8211; The downside is that one can quickly lose the sense of coherence of the whole &#8211; which is one reason why, in effect, argument based websites have not entered the mainstream of scholarly communication.<br> -->

<h3>3. Bibliographical status</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being so conceptually "concluded," a digital online publication must also be concluded in terms of its public accessiblity, it must, we may say, become a <i><b>full fledged "publication."</b></i><br>
