<h3>Synergy</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of  perception with regard to the whole goes to the root of a larger problem. Standard online publications appear as ephemeral not only because of issues intrinsic to the <a href="https://4banks.net/4b/medium.htm">medium</a>, but also, and more deeply, because, <i><b>qua aggregates, they do not develop a proper discourse</b></i>. The solution to the problem lies in letting a synergy between the two modalities play its full role: it is through such synergy that the aporia is overcome.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful, in this regard, to consider the <i><b>intuitive sense of structure</b></i> which emerged from the beginning as a fundamental trait of human nature. Even in the pre-logical and pre-linguistic phases of our species, in the farthest reaches of the Paleolithic, we can infer the existence of such a sense of structure &#8211; it is the one that made progress possible, however infinitesimally slow such progress may have been for the first two million years. The analog modality capitalizes on this intuitive sense of structure: the compositional whole is physically visible in the printed format, it lends itself fully to the perception of the reader.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then does this synergy work? It works by relying on two interrelated aspects: <a href="#structure">structure</a> and <a href="#closure">closure</a>.<br>
<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my aim is to have digital discourse assert <i><b>the same sense of structure within the digital modality</b></i>. To do so, the discourse must be conceived as such, as a discourse, with a well defined frame that allows for tensionality within itself. The websites of this cluster are constructed with this in mind, as shown concretely, with regard to the websites in this cluster, in Part 4 under <a href="d-frame.htm">frame</a> and <a href="d-multilinearity.htm">multilinearity</a>.<br><br> -->

<h3>A sense of structure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A synergy between the two modalities allows <i><b>digital discourse to mutuate a sense of structure from the analog modality</b></i> and apply it to the digital modality. This does not result in a hybrid system, but rather in a real synergy between analog and digital modalities, one that heals the <a href="systems.htm#integration">epistemological split</a> and creates in effect a new epistemological system of constructing (<a href="uses.htm#writing">writing</a>) and communicating (<a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a>) knowledge, a system based on the notion of digital discourse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A digital discourse must be constructed, and then studied, with <i><b>a clear sense of structure</b></i>. In the case of the websites in our 4banks cluster, the structure is <a href="structure.htm">spelled out</a> explicitly: it does not just articulate a Table of Contents, seen as a list or a "site map"; it is rather a statement of how the various parts are to be seen as interrelated, because they are so contructed. The parts remain such, parts of an aggreegate; but they are, at the same time, seen as organic components of a structural, compositional whole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, we may say, <i><b>a matter of sensibility and of scholarly habit</b></i>. What matters, is that the digital discourse aspect of a website be well thought out and made clear, and that the website be constructed accordingly.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital discourse: synergy</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Tensionality and connectivity (static vs. dynamic)</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Tensionality</b></i> is an essential factor of discourse in general, and of digital discourse in particular. As a simple example of what tensionality means, we may think of the rhyme in a metrically construed poem: the rhyme comes to life only if there is a larger composition (the poem), where the flow of the verses is punctuated by repeated phonic patterns. Clearly, a single verse, or scattered lines of text that do not follow a pattern, do not qualify, even if the phonic repetition were to occur. It is such patterned recurrence that creates tensionality.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that one does not have a sense of tensionality if one does not have <i><b>a perception of the compositional whole</b></i> within which tensionality may occur: in this regard, and somewhat ironically, we may say that no matter how many hyperlinks exist in a digital text, they do not evoke tensionality, but rather diffuse it &#8211; if there is no tensionality within a compoisiontl whole. Random hyperlinks, in fact, lead to a target that is only minimally expected: we know there is target and we expect to get there, but its connection to the larger composition is missing because there is no such compositional whole in the first place. In other words, the individual threads emerge as dominant, and the frame serves only as a container.<br>

<h3>Framing and contiguity (whole vs. aggregate)</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between whole and aggregate is important. It is the <a href="https://4banks.net/4b/structures.htm#contiguity">first attribute (contiguity)</a> that distinguishes the analog and the digital modalities, and, as such, it seems to <i><b>exclude the possibility, for an analog modality, to deal with a whole</b></i>: a digital modality deals in fact, by definition, with aggregates seen as composites of parts. Let us consider the example of a digital data base: here the frame corresponds to the matrix that defines the cells to be used; it is, in other words, a composite that acquires sense from being accessible in its component parts, the cells. This happens within clearly defined boundaries, for sure, but the matrix remains intrinsically open for an unlimited number of data that can fill these cells. Similarly, with a website there is a site map that outlines the contents, or more simply the top or side bars that provide direction and thus indicate how to access the information: but this remains hidden, and can again be increased or removed at will.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, in either case (data base and website), the frame is known, there is no practical limit to how expansive the content can be. This has of course major advantages, in that it allows one to expand freely the data that are marshaled in support of the argument, and to expand as well the argument by including unending parallel narratives. But <i><b>precisely because of this expansiveness, digitality is structurally unsuited for the whole</b></i>. It does, of course, bring into play the totality of the parts: but it is seen, precisely, as a sum that coincides with the parts, not as a sum that is greater than the parts.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to look at this is to think in terms of <i><b>perception</b></i>. While we have at best a perception of the matrix of a data base or of a website, we do not have a perception of its contents. This is in the very nature of things: with a printed chart we gain immediately a sense of its contents, however many pages it may occupy (unlike what happens with a digital data base); and with a book, however voluminous, we gain immediately a sense of its contents, even apart from looking at its table of contents (unlike what happens with a website).<br>

<h3>Concurrence and sequentiality (uni- vs. multi-linearity)</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the attributes of the <a href="modalities.htm#sequentiality">digital modality</a>, multilinearity is the one that more clearly brings out <i><b>the high degree of complexity of digital thought</b></i>. This complexity derives from the concurrent unfolding of multiple arguments, a concurrence which is subsumed and implied at each stage by each of the individual narratives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a non-digital setting, multilinearity is only potential. All critical throught, whether digital or not, is multilinear, in the sense that it<br><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) <b>Multilinearity</b> refers to the presence of parallel narratives, each developing its own argument but in ways that relate it to a core underlying narrative. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the process that governs <b>critical and creative thinking</b>. In critical thinking, we follow the argument set by a pre-set narrative (whether oral or printed), and we develop in our own mind parallel arguments that come to be more or less formalized in narratives that accompany the one being the object of our critique. In creative thought, we develop our own narrative relying on data which we arrange in parallel narratives so that we maycome to see how they may or may not coincide and overlap. In these two cases, critical and crative thought, multilinearity is the parallel course of arguments that develop in our own mind as we "think" (critically or creatively).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Digitally</b>, instead, multilinearity presents us with preset parallel narratives, which can be formalized with varying degrees of explicitness. In some cases the parallel argument is fully developed, in others it is present implicitly through the links that lead from on to the other in an orderly fashion.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital discourse: synergy</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Closure and continuity (closed vs. open)</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closure is the <i><b>temporal correlative of wholeness</b></i>. It refers to the moment when, in the eyes of the author, a publication can be considered complete. At this juncture, the "publication" is "published," i.e., it goes beyond the private sphere and is consigned to the public. It is an important step, which does not merely affecthe surface of the process. It rather contributes in an essential way to the definition of what a digital discourse ultimately is.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current use of websites, this moment is typically <i><b>deferred indefinitely</b></i>, or rather, it is not even considered as a real, desirable possibililty. Websites are considered to be by nature in constant flux: the fact that they are constantly being brought up to date is attractive, but it is at the same time very problematic. Such fluidity is possible only because one gives up on the notion of wholeness: chameleon-like, a website is never expected to remain the same through time. It is thus, inevitably, never expected to be whole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear awareness of this situation, but, when it is recognized as a problem, the solution that is generally adopted compounds the problem instead of solving it: it is that of citing <i><b>the date when a website has been accessed</b></i>. This compounds the problem because it consecrates it: we accept as final the lack of finality. How counterproductive this solution is, emerges clearly from the fact that the assignation of a date of access does in no way "publish" the website in question: in most cases, the website is not there to be verified any longer, and the semblance of publication is entirely entrusted to its citation &#8211; which in most cases does not quote the text, but simply refers to it indirectly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real solution is to recognize and to declare a given moment of closure, and thus to <i><b>consign to the public the current result, in its perceived wholeness</b></i>. This is how we can properly achieve a "publication" status. At the root of the problem is that one does not typically seek to establish a digital discourse in the first place, and for this reason the notion that one should look for wholeness seems to beg the question.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conceptual correlative of the temporal aspect of closure is the notion of <i><b>"publishing" a conclusion</b></i>. Given closure, one should reflect on the website seen as digital discourse, i. e., as a self-contained compositional whole. And this reflection should be part of the website itself. A discourse offers a broader scope within which tensionality obtains. It is this tensionality that creates suspense in a novel, where one expects a final "denouement," or in a complex logical argument where one expects a final point of arrival. A <i><b>conclusion</b></i>, which we normally expect in an analog publication, is not expected, and is never found, in a digital publication such as a website. And that is because there is no proper digital discourse behind a standard website.<br>

<h3>Bibliographical status</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being so temporally "closed" and conceptually "concluded," a digital online publication must also achieve a status of public accessiblity, it must, in other words, become a <i><b>full fledged "publication."</b></i>. To have a full bibliographical status, a website must not only be self-contained in and of itself, from within, it must also be identifiable as such from without.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as with the implementation of a proper digital discourse, so, too, a proper "publication" addresses the issue of an <i><b>explicit definition of wholeness</b></i>. A website is declared "whole" in the sense that it has reached a level of internal coherence that calls for an equivalent commitmente on the part of the <a href="uses.htm/#reading">reader</a>. One can expect the website to be studied, not just browsed and queried. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is eauivalent to providing a firm and stable bibligraphical status, which is otherwise missing (the indication of a <a href="#closure">date when a website has been accessed</a> being wholly inadequate to this end). This is achieved in the 4banks.net cluster by creating <i><b>firm and stable successive editions</b></i> of each website, using the concept of <a href="archives.htm#ephemeris">ephemeris</a> to create well identifiable <a href="archives.htm">archives</a>.<br>
