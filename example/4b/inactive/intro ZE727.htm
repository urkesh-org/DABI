&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section contains technical developments that could not be included in the printed book. It is an eclectic selection, which does not aim to cover complete themes in relation to those in the volume, but only to explore in a somewhat more detailed way, some aspects that serve to support and elaborate upon certain topics raised in the book.<br>
