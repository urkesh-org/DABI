<h3>The concept</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of digital narrative is central to that of <a href="digital thought.htm">digital thought</a>, where I defined it as developing an argument that relies on the sequential coordination of dynamic multilinearity. We should here look at these aaspects in some detail.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) <b>Multilinearity</b> refers to the presence of parallel narratives, each developing its own argument but in ways that relate it to a core underlying narrative. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the process that governs <b>critical and creative thinking</b>. In critical thinking, we follow the argument set by a pre-set narrative (whether oral or printed), and we develop in our own mind parallel arguments that come to be more or less formalized in narratives that accompany the one being the object of our critique. In creative thought, we develop our own narrative relying on data which we arrange in parallel narratives so that we maycome to see how they may or may not coincide and overlap. In these two cases, critical and crative thought, multilinearity is the parallel course of arguments that develop in our own mind as we "think" (critically or creatively).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Digitally</b>, instead, multilinearity presents us with preset parallel narratives, which can be formalized with varying degrees of explicitness. In some cases the parallel argument is fully developed, in others it is present implicitly through the links that lead from on to the other in an orderly fashion.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) <b>sequential coordination</b><br><br>
