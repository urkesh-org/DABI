<h3>The concept</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, the term "digital thought" would be understood with the adjective "digital" taken in a subjective sense: the phrase refers then to <i><b>a digital medium that thinks</b></i>. The primacy of digitality is here affirmed, and the human subject becomes the object, the target of algorithms that control a :him" that has become a "it." It is the goal of <a href="#AI">artificial intelligence</a>. Thus, a digital thought clone is the digital twin of a live person, a robot that can closely replicate choices on the basis of known patterns exhibited by that person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the term is the exact reverse: digitality is then taken in an objective sense, so that the phrase refers to <i><b>a thinking human who controls digitality</b></i>. The notion of control is taken in its full sense, i. e., in the sense that the value of digitality is not only fully accepted, but in fact exploited to the hilt. We may point to two ways in which this happens.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first relates to the way in which <i><b>an argument is brought to bear from the outside</b></i> to a bank of data that have been <a href="https://4banks.net/4b/systems.htm#data_cat">categorized and can be accordingly queried</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is more complex. It relates to the way in which human thought <i><b>controls the dynamics of a digital argument</b></i>, and not only the statics of digital data (as in the first case). This is what I aim to achieve with the notion of <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, which arises from the way a website is conceived, whether it is automaticcally generated or not.<br>

<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend to associate thought to digitality in a way that subsumes the former to the latter. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate point of arrival in this trajectory: if human thinking be seen as the process of bracing elements that are distant in reality, artificial intellgence may be seen as a set of pre-ordained procedures that effectively achieve the same bracing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital thought is the reverse of artificial intelligence, or, rather, it is superimposed on it. It looks at the results of this pre-ordained bracing and it braces them it turn, following patterns of bracing that are not pre-ordained.<br>

Centrality of the argument<br>

     Artificial intelligence precludes the argument, it gives you the end of the argument path<br>

     Digital thought opens up new pathwas to yuor ability to develop the argument<br>

<h3>Digital narrative</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a more important aspect ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A central aspect of digital thought that is pertinent for us here is ythe one pertaining to digital narratives. I view a digital narrative as developing an argument that relies on the sequential coordination of dynamic multilinearity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to a <a href="narrative.htm">separate page</a> where one can see in some detail what means, with a specific example. <br>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the six bibliographically oriented websites of 4banks.net the concept of digital narrative is implemented in two parallel ways: please refer to the <a href="../Mes-rel/home.htm" target=blank>Religion website</a> as an example.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is a "core" narrative wihch serves as the guiding thread for the rest of the website. At this point, this core narrative is the book to which the website was originally intended to serve as a companion (see under <a href="history-p.htm">History of the project</a>). In subsequent phases of the project, we will add other books that we consider of central importance for  the inquiry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Themes and Monographs develop special tpoics of interest. <i>Themes</i> are limited in scope to a single website page, whereas <i>Monographs</i> expand the tratment of the topic to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus all the data bases in section II of each website (e.g.,) are relayed to this book.<br>
