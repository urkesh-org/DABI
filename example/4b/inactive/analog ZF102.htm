<h3>Structure and approach/access</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each website is so structured as to serve the two stated <a href="aims.htm">aims</a> (substantive and digital) in ways that are consonant but distinct. There is, we may say, a bimodal structure, in the sense that the data as presented in the websites are designed so as to be accessed in parallel ways depending on the intent with which one approaches the website.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will highlight here three such modalities: contiguity, connectivity and sequentiality, for each of which one will find in the websites a dual representation of the data. I elaborate on these principles, and give examples, in the sections indicated in the left side bar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a diagram that lists the details of the structure in relationship to the two main aims of the project.<br>

<a name=contiguity></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Structures: analog vs. digital</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Contiguity: closed vs. open</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constrast paper with digital publications<br>
paper publication as closed <br>
digital as open -- subsuming both substantive and digital approaches<br>
opposed to synergy<br>
Continuity -- keyword in normal description<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an analogical mode, the data are seen as contiguous with each other, not only formally (as on a printed page), but also conceptually: they form a continuum. The flow of the argument takes place <i><b>within the bounds of this continuum</b></i>, and the reader is encased, as it were, within this same continuum. We tend to look at the argument as a whole more than as an aggreegate of parts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comparison, an analog thermometer consists of an element, such as mercury, which expands in correspondence to the temperature with which it is in contact: contiguity is here found in the way in which the element, mercury, expands, and the measure is set through a preordained gauge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a digital mode, on the other hand, the data are both contiguous and not: on the one hand they are encased within the same argument flow that applies to the analog modality, while on the other the argument emerges more as an <i><b>aggregate of disparate elements</b></i> than as a whole, and we tend to see the argument in this light, precisely as the sum of its parts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comparison, we may think of a digital picture, which is made up of individual pixels that can be identified as such, as when we speak of the DPI (dots per inch) factor.<br>

<h3>Connectivity: static vs. dynamic</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an analogical mode, connectivity among data is potential, hence static. The essential characteristics of critical judgment consists in bracing the disparate elements within the continuum of the argument flow. In an analog mode, <i><b>this bracing happens in the mind of the reader</b></i>, who can "jump" back and forth, as well as outside of, the argument flow, on the strength of his or her own knowledge. The elements of the argument, the moments in its flow, as well as the data on which it is based, are there to be seen; but they are juxtaposed statically.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a digital mode, instead, <i><b>bracing is inherent in the very structural make-up of the data</b></i>. Connectivity among the moments of the argument flow, as well as the data on which the argument rests, is built into these elements, moments and data, which are thus linked dynamically with each other.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comparison, we may think of the difference between looking at the picture of a landscape and actually driving through it. The picture will evoke memories of other pictures, which may be produced to favor a critical confrontation: the picture in itself is static, and the dynamics of the comparison is introduced by the observer. The drive through, on the other hand, is dynamic by its very nature: it unfolds a series of views,  which correspond to the pictures one could view statically, except that here they move of their own accord in and out of the perceptual range of the observer, presenting built-in comparisons as one moves forward.<br>
<br>

<a name=sequentiality></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Structures: analog vs. digital</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Sequentiality: unilinear vs. multilinear</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unilinear argument follows <i><b>a single thread</b></i>. On a printed page, footnotes point to parallel threads, without however following them in their entirety. There are also parallel threads that are developed more explicitly, in the form of excursuses and appendices. But these are generally limited in scope, and more difficult to see concurrently with the main thread of the central argument. Sequentiality is thus tightly tied to the flow of the argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comparison, we may think of a song, where the melody flows carried by a single voice. We may focus on the tune or the lyrics, we may reproduce the melody on an instrument, we may consider isolated segments &#8211; but the fundamental sequentiality of the single human voice remains essentially unilinear in its structure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multilinear approach, on the other hand, is so structured as to propose <i><b>concurrent threads</b></i> that run simultaneously. Footnotes do not properly exist because they are raised to the level of the primary argument, and so are excursuses and appendices. We have a multi-tiered construct where a single argument flows along synchronous tracks, as if producing a harmony out of distinct, but consonant contributing elements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of comparison we may think of a symphony or better yet of a concerto for orchestra and a solo instrument, where parallel registers flow along together within the compass of a single unified score. We may say that a properly digital text is structured along the lines of a conceptual harmony that emulates that of an orchestral ensemble.<br>

<a name=surface></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Structures: analog vs. digital</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Surface and deep structure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structural interaction between the two modal sets may be seen, if only analogically, in terms of the correlation that was first raised in linguistics between surface and deep structure. We may say that surface structure corresponds to the <i><b>electronic</b></i> dimension, and deep structure to the <i><b>properly digital</b></i> dimension of the website structure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface structure is the one we access in a normal reading mode: we follow in a unilinear frame of mind an argument that is displayed in a way that is structurally the same as on the printed page; similarly, we search for information that is tied to the unilinear reading, much as we would a footnote in a printed text. We may say that the surface structure is <i><b>electronic</b></i> in nature rather than digital: the data are accessed on the computer, but not in terms of their inner digital qualities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>properly digital</b></i> configuration of the website corresponds to the deep structure level. It goes beyond an electronic rendering because of the dynamic interlacing of the various elements. We make use of this digital modality when we work with a digital data base, which builds on an active relationality among cells that does not exist in a printed spreadsheet. A digitally structured website raises this feature to the level of the narrative, as is explained in more detail on a <a href="narrative.htm">separate page</a>.<br>

<a name=synergy></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Structures: analog vs. digital</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Synergy</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two approaches are not to be seen in opposition to each other, as if the digital were expected to supersede the analogical. Rather, the two are to be seen as concurrent, on the basis of a productive synergy. Let us think of it in terms of the modalities mentioned <a href="structure">above</a> &#8211; contiguity, connectivity, sequentiality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The static view encourages reflection, through a certain distance from the observed: one focuses on the individual moments in the unilinear flow of the argument, even at the cost of keeping in the background the potential bracing with other pertinent moments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dynamic view, on the other hand, encourages bracing by presenting potential comparables within the parallel threads present in a multilinear organization of the data, even at the cost of glossing over details.<br>

<h3>Perspectives</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the first aim (a comprehensive bibliographical support<!--  for <a href="../4banks-index.htm">six aspects</a> of cultural history as they relate to ancient Mesopotamia. , one will find in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> a discursive approach to these topics, and in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small> a set of data in a form that is consonant with a standard annotated bibliography.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the second, methodological, aim, I intend to show how a browser based approach, as available in a website, provides a good tool for combining a data set with an argument based narrative. This is achieved by interlacing the sequential texts as given in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> with the data found in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small>, and viceversa.<br>
