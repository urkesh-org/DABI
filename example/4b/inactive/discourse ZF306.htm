<h3>The concept</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of digital discourse is at the heart of the methodological effort of the 4banks cluster of websites. It refers to the <i><b>frame within which argument and data are encased</b></i>, where the notion of "frame" is particularly significant because it provides a self-imposed limit to what would otherwise remain too loose an aggregate of parts. A frame is a conceptual entity that corresponds to a compositional array: the composition is what holds the parts together by identifying ("framing") their reciprocal relationships. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Tensionality</b></i> is an essential factor of discourse in general, and of the digital discourse in particular. As a simple example of what tensionality means, we may think of the rhyme in a metrically construed poem: the rhyme comes to life only if there is a larger composition (the poem) where the unfolding flow of the verses is punctuated by repeated phonic patterns. Clearly, a single verse, or scattered lines of text that do not follow a pattern, do not qualify, even if the phonic repetition were to occur. It is such patterned recurrence that creates tensionality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that one does not have a sense of tensionality if one does not have <i><b>a perception of the compositional whole</b></i> within which the tensionality may occur: in this regard, and somewhat ironically, no matter how many hyperlinks exist in a digital text, they do not evoke tensionality, but rather diffuse it, because they lead to a target that is only minimally expected (we know there is target and we expect to get there, but its connection to the larger composition is missing because there is no such compositional whole in the first place). In other words, the individual threads emerge as dominant, and the frame serves only as a container<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A discourse offers a broader scope within which tensionality obtains. It is this tensionality that creates suspense in a novel, where one expects a final "denouement," or in a coplex logical argument where one expects a the final point of arrival. A <i><b>conclusion</b></i> is what we normally expect in an analog publication, but it is something that is not expected, and is never found, in a digital publication such as a website. And that is because there is no proper digital discourse behind a standard website.<br>

<h3>Facing the whole</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital <a href="structures.htm#modalities">modality</a> is such that, in and of itself, it seems to exclude the possibility of dealing with a whole: it deals in fact, by definition, with aggregates seen as composites of parts. Thus, we may rightly say that <i><b>digitality is structurally unsuited for the whole</b></i>. It does, of course, bring into play the totality of the parts: but it is seen, preciely, as a sum that coincides with the parts, not as a sum that is greater than the parts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of frame is helpful in helping us define the <i><b>difference between an aggregate and a whole</b></i>. With a digital data base, the frame corresponds to the matrix that defines the cells to be used, it is, in other words, a composite that acquires sense from being accessible in its component parts, the cells. This happens within clearly defined boundaries, for sure, but the matrix remains intrinsically open for an unlimited number of data that can fill these cells. With a website, there is a site map that outlines the contents, or more simply the top or side bars that provide direction and thus indicate how to access the information: but this remains hidden, and can again be increased or removed at will. &#8211; While, in either case, the frame is known, there is no practical limit to how expansive the content can be. This has of course major advantages, as it allows one to expand freely the data that are marshalled in support of the arguments, and to expand as well the argument by including unending parallel narratives. The downside is that one can quickly lose the sense of coherence of the whole &#8211; which is one reason why, in effect, argument based websites have not entered the mainstream of scholarly communication.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to look at this is to think in terms of <i><b>perception</b></i>. While we have at best a perception of the frame of a data base or of a website, we do not have a perception of its contents. This is in the very nature of things: with a printed chart we gain immediately a sense of its contents, however many pages it may occupy (unlike what happens with a digital data base); and with a book, however voluminous, we gain immediately a sense of its contents, even apart from looking at its table of contents (unlike what happens with a website) The generally accepted unsuitability of a website for a <a href="conclusion.htm">conclusion</a> is one further indication of this: we cannot imagine a concluding reflection for a website because it is not, structurally, amenable to a perception of what it may be as a whole. <br>

<h3>An intuitive sense of structure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it a <i><b>fundamental trait of human nature</b></i> that we have an intuitive sense of structure. Even in the pre-logical and pre-linguistic phases of our species, in the farthest reaches of the Paleolithic, we can infer the existence of such a sense of structure &#8211; it is the one that made progress possible, however infinitesimaly slow such progress may have been for the first two million years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analog modality capitalizes on this intuitive sense of structure: the compositional whole is physically visible in the printed format, and to a large extent also in a para-digital format (as with a .PDF). And my aim is to have digital discourse assert <i><b>the same sense of structure within the digital modality</b></i>. To do so, the discourse must be conceived as such, as a discourse, with a well defined frame that allows for tensionality within itself. The websites of this cluster are constructed with this in mind, as shown concretely, with regard to the websites in this cluster, in Part 4 under <a href="d-frame.htm">frame</a> and <a href="d-multilinearity.htm">multilinearity</a>.<br><br>

<h3>Synergy</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A <i><b><a href="modalities.htm/synergy">synergy</a> between analog and digital modalities</b></i> must come reciprocally into play in order to allow for the intuitive sense of structure to face the whole when reading a digital discourse. It is not a hybrid system, it is a true synergy that integrates the two modalities. The goal is to heal the <a href="systems.htm#integration">epistemological split</a> by creating in effect a new epistemological system ofonstructing (<a href="#writing">writing</a>) and communicating (<a href="#reading">reading</a>) knowledge.<br>

<h3>"Writing" a digital discourse</h3></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One does not typically approach the task of <i><b>constructing a website</b></i> the way one goes about writing a book or an article. Precisely because the intrinsic structure of a digital discourse is that of an open, dynamic and multilinear aggregate, it is difficult to conceive of it as a whole. And yet one must strive to maintain an overall coherence that makes full use of the expansive mode of the digital structure, while at the same time maintaining and displaying the cohesion of the parts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="systems.htm#split"><b><i>split epistemological system</i></b></a> that is currently the standard in scholarship, does not achieve this goal. It does create the presuppositions for it, especially with a <a href="systems.htm#data_cat">data base system</a> that rests on a pre-set categorization system. But even in this case the sense of the whole is limited to the frame (the matrix of the data base) and does not extend to the content (the data entered in the cells).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does <i><b>web design</b></i> address the issue of digital discourse. It is essentially geared (a) to aesthetics, aiming to make the display  attractive and effective in calling attention to the main point(s) of the intended message, and it is geared (b) to functionality, aiming to direct the attention of the users to what specific information they may be looking for.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing a digital discourse entails, instead, a concern for an integration of the two modalities, in such a way that <i><b>the analog and digital dimensions may be equally interlaced</b></i> as part of a single compositional whole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A website is the standard embodiment of a digital discourse</b></i>, and the websites in this cluster are meant to serve as an example of how this can happen. A <a href="d-frame.htm">separate section</a> in this hub website deals with the mechanics of how this is implemented.<br>

<h3>"Reading" a digital discourse</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Terminology</b></i> is indicative of an  underlying situation that affects us all deeply. We do not typically speak of reading a website, or studying it. Instead of "readers" we speak of "users" who "surf" on the crest of a moving wave, or "browse" as does an animal nibbling at twigs. We do not think of depth or of nourishment. Which is instead the aim of "reading" and "studying."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may well ask: when is the last time you have <i><b>leisurely "read" a good website</b></i>, and have enjoyed it the way you have enjoyed books that have left a deep trace in your mindset, and even helped shape your character?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundmental reason is that websites are <i><b>not written qua digital discourses</b></i>. Reading is consonant with writing, and as long as we do not properly "write" a website, but only "construct" it (another indicative term) as an aggregate of pieces, we will not have "readers." A reader will look for the whole behind the aggregate, will seek for the impact to be derived from an engaged composition. It is a challenge, one that brings us back to a renewewd appreciation of what <a href="humanities.htm">humanism</a> ultimately means.<br>
