<h4>The physical medium</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cuneiform tablet requires only a tactile and visual interface: one only needs to be able to hold the tablet in one's hand and see it. The same goes for a book. There is an <i><b>immediate perception of the whole</b></i> even before one seeks to go through the details.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A website, on the other hand, requires a host of concurring elements, which <i><b>mediate profoundly the perception one can gain of the whole</b></i> &#8211; from an instrument that transfers signals to another (a computer) and a source of energy that keeps it operative (electricity) to a set of operational mechanisms that allow in the first place the computer to access the signals (a platform) and a similar set of mechanisms that interpret my specific signal (a browser).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time in the future, a cuneiform tablet or a book will still be accessible to humans in the same way in which they are accessible to us today, in the same way in which they were accessible to their originators whether millennia or centuries ago. <i><b>The interface is human</b></i>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same point in time, on the other hand, even just a few years from now, the website I read today will require a different set of mechanisms for it to be accessible to me, let alone to others. <i><b>The interface is not human</b></i>.<br>

<h4>Fragility: durability and portability</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the difference between the analogical and the digital dimension, and it is a difference that underscores the respective fragility of the two systems.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the analogical dimension there are <i><b>degrees of fragility</b></i>: a clay tablet is physically more durable than a papyrus scroll, a leather scroll, a paper book: which is why we have the original manuscripts of a poem composed more than four millennia ago, but have no originals of European authors  before the late Middle Ages (save public documents that were consigned to some more durable medium like stone).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragility of  digital work is incomparably greater, on two counts, durabiity and portability. <b>Durability</b> entails the static availabilty of physical elements (electricity, a computer of a given type). <b>Portability</b> entails the dynamic reconfiguration of factors (operating system, browsers) that give a viable embodiment to what the original authors intended to convey to their intelocutors.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this applies to <i><b>the website as a finished product</b></i>. Equally complex is the updating of existing websites or the production of new websites that make use of the old ones. Data are not consigned to a physical medium through a single human act (tapping the surface of a clay tablet with a sylus or drawing continuous lines with a pen on papyrus, leather or paper). Even printing is a relatively simple event, where a machine performs a task that can be encompassed visually by anyone who sees it in operation. It is very different with a website. Here we speak properly of "input," whereby we mean that elements are consigned, in their most elementary format, to a system (the program) that transdfers them into a visible "output."<br>

<h4>Impact on use of websites in scholarship</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems constitute one of basic reasons for the reluctance to adopt websites as a permanent type of scholarly comunication. The underlying sense that websites are transient and ephemeral is made evident by what has become a standard practice of indicating, in publications, when the website has actually been accessed.<br>

<h4>Bibliographical status</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two symmetrical ways in which <i><b>current electronic publishing thwarts the scholarly concern</b></i> for proper and firm bibliographical attribution. In the first case, a native digital publication is devoid of such attribution, while in the second a derivative digital publication removes a preciously existing attribution.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In a website seen as a <i><b>native digital publication</b></i>, the problem arises because there is no concern for the wholeness of the publication. The problem must therefore be addressed at the source, by setting parameters that are apt to <a href="synergy.htm#status">formalize the wholeness of the product</a> and make it permanent.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A <i><b>derivative digital publication</b></i> is one that renders electronically a publication originally printed on paper. There are two ways in which this can occur, and the difference is significant for us in this context.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first type of derivative digital publication is through an exact, we might say photographic, reproduction of the original, typically in <i><b>a .PDF format</b></i>. The important detail for our concern is that this reproduction maintains the original pagination, and thus makes precise citations possible.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type reconfigures the text to fit a new, virtual page format that does not correspond to the original. It is especially designed for a device that mimicks the book format, i. e. an e-reader such as the Amazon Kindle or the Sony Reader. What happens in this case is that the original pagination is jettysoned and no new pagination is given. The text can be exported and be read on other devices, predominantly today in <i><b>the .ePub format</b></i>, and this, too, remains devoid of any reference to the original pagination. This can be seen as an unwitting attack on bibliographical integrity: it becomes in fact impossible to cite a source by the page where one would go to find the text cited.<br>

<a name="epub"></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are instances when one cannot avoid using an .ePub resource, for instance when a printed copy is unavailable in a library, or some other external event (as with the 2020-21 COVID pandemic) makes it impossible to consult a printed book in a library. This problem has affected concretely my work on this website, as with the case of <a href="excerpts/Birkerts 1994.htm">Birkerts 1994</a>. In such cases, I have resorted to the solution of <i><b>citing the original work by referring to the chapter</b></i> instead of the page number. The problem is alleviated by the fact that a quote can be found in the electronic original through the search function.<br>
