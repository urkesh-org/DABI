<h3>Disambiguating the concept</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its current use, the term "digital thought" is understood with the adjective "digital" taken in a (grammatically) subjective sense: the phrase refers then to <i><b>a digital medium as a subject that thinks</b></i>. The primacy of digitality is here affirmed, and the human subject becomes the object, the target of algorithms that control a "him" that has become a "it." It is the goal of <a href="#AI">artificial intelligence</a>. In turn, a digital thought clone is the digital twin of a live person, a robot that can closely replicate choices on the basis of known patterns exhibited by that person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the term is the exact reverse: digitality is then taken in a (grammatically) objective sense, so that the phrase refers to <i><b>a thinking human who controls digitality as the object</b></i>. The notion of control is taken in its full sense, i. e., in the sense that the value of digitality is not only fully accepted, but in fact exploited to the hilt. We may point to two ways in which this happens: <a href="#data">data bases</a> and <a href="#discourse">digital discourse</a>.<br>

<h3>Critical and creative thought</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core of critical and creative thinking are two aspects of our ability to <i><b>brace different levels</b></i> of perception and understanding: establishing links and following parallel tracks..<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand there is the ability to <i><b>establish links among elements</b></i> that do not appear at first to be so connected. This we do by reaching into the recesses of our personal knowledge, and by following up clues we see either in the world around us or in the literature about a given subject. We may say that <i>critical</i> thought assesses what others have proposed, and <i>creative</i> what is given in nature.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other, and at a higher level of complexity, there is the ability to <i><b>follow parallel tracks</b></i> that are not immediately apparent as being parallel. On the one hand, there is a track that is given, hence is very apparent, whether as someone else's argument, or as a string of data. On the other hand, there is a track of our own making which we let unfold concurrently in our mind: to the extent that they overlap there is congruence, and where they diverge a new potential opens up.<br>

<h3>Implementing digital thought</h3>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two aspects that are at the core of critical and creative thought, are also found in the <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, where they can be described as <i><b>connectivity and sequentiality</b></i>. <a href="modalities.htm#connectivity">Connectivity</a> establishes dynamic links among elements in a digital narrative: it is dynamic in the sense that it is accessed in actuality (clicking on a hyperlink in a digital mode) and is not simply indicated as existing (reading the reference in a footnote, in an analog mode). &#8211; And <a href="synergy.htm#directionality">sequentiality</a> proposes two or more concurrent paths that run parallel to each other and <a href="discourse.htm#structure">overlap in given segments</a> of their individual linear sequence.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not replace critical and creative thought; they only make explicit a much richer set of possible threads than can be fouind in oral or written discourse. It is in this sense that digital thought, <a href="#concept">understood</a> as human thought that controls digitality, looks critically at the threads established by connectivity and sequentiality, as given in the digital dimension, and goes beyond by establising further links and seeing more hidden parallel tracks. In other words, <i><b>digital thought IS critical and creative thought enhanced to the nth power because it can rely on digital discourse</b></i>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens specifically in the two configurations of a <a href="narrative.htm">digital text</a> that are most directly related to digital thought: databases and narrative websites. We do not consider here texts that may be considered as <a href="narrative.htm#para-digital">para-digital</a>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital thought</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Tabular data bases</h3>
<mark>TO data.htm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A database, exhibits <i><b>connectivity among cells and sequentiality among rows or columns</b></i>. A cell is linked to another through shared attributes that are clearly defined and serve as pegs for the linking. A row is parallel to another, as is a column, and they can be compared because of the same set of parameters that define the individual cells.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is fundamental in this regard is <i><b>the categorization system which governs the definition of the pertinent parameters</b></i>. The query power of a data base, wihch sets in motion logivcal thought, is only correlative to the quality of the underlying <a href="systems.htm#data_cat">categorization</a>. The effort that goes in establishing a proper grammar for the data is very much in the nature of an argument, and often a very sophisticated one at that.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However &#8211; tabular data bases are <i><b>argument driven only in a passive sense</b></i>: the argument is all in the categorization system that is upstream of the data base itself, and the relational dimension among cells and rows and colums is only potential. The argument power of the categorization system lies in the ability to extract all the meaningful attributes of the data in question, and to articulate them "grammatically," i. e., in a way that is systemically well coordinated and explicitly structured. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be <i><b>activated through a query function that spells out the parameters for the search</b></i>, and the query originates in a human argument brought to bear on it from the outside. This query is also part of the argument, as it aligns itself with the what the categorization system has specified in the first palce.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, <i><b>an entry in any given cell is not explained by the contents of the neighboring cells</b></i>. They are related in function of the categorization system which operates upstream of the data base, but they are not interacting with each other. What activates their relationship is a query, which is in function of an argument brought to bear from the outside. This (human) argument is the result of (dynamic) digital thought applied to the (static) data array. It is this argument external to the database that gives it its espitemological power.<br></mark>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this limited sense, data bases can be seen as <i><b>paradigmatic of digital thought</b></i>. We (as humans) bring to bear our (human) thought on data elaborated on the basis of (human) categorization, and we (humans) build an argument accordingly. It is abundantly clear that "thought" is understood as having "humans" as subject, and that the adjective "digital" refers to the object of this thought.<br>

<h3>Digital discourse</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation with a <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a> array is considerably <i><b>more complex than with a database</b></i>. The complexity derives from two major factors: the nature of the elements and the nature of their interrelationship.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  <i><b>elements of a digital discourse</b></i> consist of multiple and diverse layers with <a href="discourse.htm#structure">parallel narratives and correlative databases</a>. The narratives differ substantially from the cells of a database because there is no categorization system that defines and thus limits the nature of their content. They are segments of a continuum, just like the pragraph you are reading now. Thia ia further complicated by the fact that the narrative has equal access to the cells of a database, and thus draws on the categorization system of that particular database.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of complexity of the <i><b>interrelationship among elements of a digital discourse</b></i> is correlative to the nature of the elements themselves. One cannot query a narrative since there is no categorization systme that establishes parameters suited for the query. Nor do the multiple layers declare themselves as they can be shown diagrammatically in a <a href="discourse.htm#structure">chart</a>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thia is where digital thought comes into play. <i><b>Digital thought follows a digital discoure in its directional flow</b></i>: we must read it as we do an analaog discourse, but with a mind open and attentive to the existence of the parallel tracks, however unseen they may be. An <a href="uses.htm#reading">example</a> may clarify the issue, but the point to be stressed here is that digital thought, applied to digital discourse, performs a function identical in substance to that of critical and creative thought applied to an analog discourse, but relying on a web of explicit relationships which is exponentially greater than that avaivable in the latter.<br>

<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <a href="#concept">indicated</a>, we tend to associate thought to digitality in a way that subsumes the former to the latter. <i><b>Artificial intelligence is the ultimate point of arrival in this trajectory</b></i>: if human thinking be seen as the process of bracing elements that are distant in reality, artificial intellgence may be seen as a set of procedures that effectively achieves the same bracing &#8211; but with procedures that are pre-ordained.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Digital thought is then the reverse of artificial intelligence</b></i>. Perhaps better, it incorporates it, because it looks at the results of the pre-ordained bracing and it braces these results in turn, following patterns of bracing that are not pre-ordained. In a sense, we may say that artificial intelligence precludes the argument at the very moment that it develops it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may contrast artificial intelligence and digital thought to one another as being <i><b>inorganic vs. organic</b></i>. The former is inorganic in the sense that it replicates patterns, and replicates as well the ability to create patterns, but always on the basis of preordained parameters. It cannot, properly speaking, "experiment". An experiment is something organic, which entails <small><small></small></small>operating on the basis of choices that are unpredictable, not preset, not preordained, not algorithmic in nature. Digital thought performs precisely that function, relying on a wide open web of arguments and data that are so preset.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital thought</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Consciousness</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consciousness is very much part of digital thought, in a way that is <i><b>inversely proportional to what happens with artificial intelligence</b></i>. As such, it entails an organic relationship to the world: understood as the faculty whereby the subject is looking critically at himself or herself, consciousness proposes, at the same time, closeness and distancing.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>One gains distance from oneself</b></i> by considering from without not only one's own reasoning, with its attendant presuppositions, but also one's own self as a whole as seen from the outside. We appear then to ourselves not just as a set of factors (emotional, intellectual, etc.) to be analyzed (qua aggregates), but as a single persona whom we cannot reduce to predictable components.  It is a distancing that does not occur with artificial intelligence.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, precisely because of this posture, there is <i><b>a tight closeness</b></i> that emerges: it comes from the fact that the target is my own self, and this self-awareness leads me to a core that is impervious to the fragmentation of analysis. I come in touch with myself because I am at the same time the subject and the target. Hence the closeness: the "I" is the critical and constant element in the equation. And it is, again, a closeness that does not occur with artificial intelligence.<br>

<h3>The epistemological impact</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial intelligence cannot be equated digital thought, while consciousness is seen as a factor in the implementation of digital thought. If that is so, what conclusion can be drawn with regard to the special <i><b>epistemological dimension of digital thought</b></i>, i. e., its ability to gain and to communicate knowledge? <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is that <i><b>digital thought remains intrinsically human</b></i>. Consciousness reveals traits that appear to be incommensurate to the breaking it down into components parts that could be handled "artificially": the whole retains a unique distinctiveness over the aggregate. So we cannot replace our intelligence or our consciousness with a non-human (digital) equivalent. In this close correspondence between whole and aggregate we see one further manifestation of the <a href="synergy.htm#framing">synergy</a> that characterizes the interaction between analog and digital dimensions. We may look at two aspects in particular: experience and desire.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital thought brings to bear critical judgment on data dissected in their minutest parts, and on the arguments (digital discourses) that are constructed around them. It does so relying on a variety of faculties that contribute to <i><b>knowledge seen in its full human dimension, and thus including experience, intuition, instinct, desire</b></i>. It is on digital thought so understood that <a href="humanities.htm#discourse">digital humanism</a> rests.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epistemological impact emerges especially in the <i><b>correlation between distancing and closeness</b></i>. Digital thought can assess the whole from a distance, as an aggregate, in effect disaggregating it into its component parts. It can, at the same time, retain the whole as such and probe its depth with closeness.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<a name=quantification></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Digital thought</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Quantification</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come to <i><b>rely, instinctively, on quantification</b></i>, and the trend started well before computers became common place. It has long since been insufficient to say that the weather is hot, one feels compelled to specify the degrees. To know and say that the temperature is "110&#0176; Fahrenheit" would give you a physical sense of heat, while "-10&#0176; Fahrenheit" would make you shiver.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universal use of tabular spreadsheets has accelerated this trend and has brought about a <i><b>change in our mental habits</b></i>. We rely more and more on a quantification of our daily chores, and we expect as much. A news report can hardly be credible if it is not supported by graphs summarizing data and giving percentages, to the point that we have become sensitive to even the slightest decimal change in percentages of political polls, market analysis, and so on. This also plays an important role in scholarship, where it is being put regularly to the best of good uses. Instead of saying that we have a large amount of data supporting a certain argument, we can indicate precisely what that amount is, and indicate the parameters that have made it possible. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations help us in placing the question of digital thought in a <i><b>broader frame of reference</b></i>. In a way, the trend toward quantification is in line with the privileged status we tend to give artificial intelligence over experience and desire, or more generally over perception. And the understanding of digital thought as I propose it here aims to go against that trend. It is clearly not a matter of downplaying the relevance of quantification, or more broadly, of the digital abililty at controlling data in their minutest dissected reality. Quite the opposite: these are indispensable points of arrival of digital analysis. But they are at the same time points of departure as they open to a confrontation with digital thought which still brings to bear on them the full impact of the irrepaceable human insight.<br>

<h3>Big data</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital thought as explained here sheds an interesting light on the question of big data. <i><b>"Bigness"</b></i> refers obviously not just to the quantitative dimension of how many data there are, but especially to the complexity of the interrelatinships among them. And both, number and complexity, lend themselves ideally to an automated handling.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, too, digital thought does not abdicate its essential role. The question it faces is how to arrive at <i><b>a critical judgement</b></i> of the results that this automated handling proposes. This, too, is ultimately to be presented as an argument, one that follows the rules of digital discourse.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>data of 4banks websites</b></i> do not qualify as big data, but the procedures proposed here are applicable and thus informative. (The <a href="http://www.urkesh.org/record" target="blank">urkesh.org/record</a> websites, on the other hand, do deal with big data.) <br>
