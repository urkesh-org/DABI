<h3>Construction and fruition</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>The input</b></i> consists of plain text with links to external sources containing additional material such as images. The text is given in the simplest digital format (essentially, ASCII characters), with non-textual formatting commands also given in ASCII characters, the simplest current "markup language" being HTML. This gives the maximum <a href="medium.htm#fragility">durability</a> to the input text.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>The output</b></i> is a display such as the one you are currently reading here. It is made possible through a browser that formats on the fly the input on the basis of the non-textual formatting commands contained in the input &#8211; hence the term "browser edition" for this particular type of publication.<br>

<h3>"Writing" a digital discourse</h3></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One does not typically approach the task of constructing a website the way one goes about writing a book or an article, as well one should. The main obstacle is not technical, but conceptual: one conceives of a website <i><b>not as a structural whole, but rather as a container</b></i> where pieces are gathered with a minimal coherence, of the type one finds on a supermarket shelf. Items are added as they come to attention, followign an overall scheme that gives unity to the whole, but without developing any overriding argument. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>The current overriding concern in constructing a website is in the area of web design</b></i>. But this is essentially geared to (a) aesthetics, aiming to make the display  attractive and effective in calling attention to the main point(s) of the intended message, and to (b) functionality, aiming to direct the attention of the users to what specific information they may be looking for. Web design corresponds to what a publishing house would do for a paper publication, from typesetting, to typography and printing. But where does the "author" comes in the writing of a website?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>The distinctive authorial responsibility for a website lies in the area of <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a></b></i>. The author must not only produce text that unfolds a given single argument, but in fact develop at the same time multiple arguments that can be accessed concurrently and provide at the same time dynamic access to data that are tightly linked to each of these arguments. It is a way of "writing" that differs from the one we are used to not only technically, but also, and especially, conceptually.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>The challenge is in keeping the whole in mind while working on the parts</b></i>. Not that this is not an issue with the analog approach to writing: the coherence of an arugment and the appropriateness of the data marshalled in its support is the goal of any composition that has ever been attempted. The hurdle with digital discourse is in the complexity of relating parallel layers so as to achieve an effective structural multilinearity.<br>
<br>

<!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing a digital discourse entails, instead, a concern for an integration of the two modalities, in such a way that <i><b>the analog and digital dimensions may be equally interlaced</b></i> as part of a single compositional whole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A website is the standard embodiment of a digital discourse</b></i>, and the websites in this cluster are meant to serve as an example of how this can happen. A <a href="d-frame.htm">separate section</a> in this hub website deals with the mechanics of how this is implemented. --><br>

<h3>"Reading" a digital discourse</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Terminology</b></i> is indicative of an  underlying situation that affects us all deeply. We do not typically speak of reading a website, or studying it. Instead of "readers" we speak of "users" who "surf" on the crest of a moving wave, or "browse" as does an animal nibbling at twigs. We do not think of depth or of nourishment. Which is instead the aim of "reading" and "studying."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may well ask: when is the last time you have <i><b>leisurely "read" a good website</b></i>, and have enjoyed it the way you have enjoyed books that have left a deep trace in your mindset, and even helped shape your character?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundmental reason is that websites are <i><b>not written qua digital discourses</b></i>. Reading is consonant with writing, and as long as we do not properly "write" a website, but only "construct" it (another indicative term) as an aggregate of pieces, we will not have "readers." A reader will look for the whole behind the aggregate, will seek for the impact to be derived from an engaged composition. It is a challenge, one that brings us back to a renewewd appreciation of what <a href="humanities.htm">humanism</a> ultimately means.<br>

<h3>Perspectives</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the first aim (a comprehensive bibliographical support<!--  for <a href="../4banks-index.htm">six aspects</a> of cultural history as they relate to ancient Mesopotamia. , one will find in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> a discursive approach to these topics, and in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small> a set of data in a form that is consonant with a standard annotated bibliography.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the second, methodological, aim, I intend to show how a browser based approach, as available in a website, provides a good tool for combining a data set with an argument based narrative. This is achieved by interlacing the sequential texts as given in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> with the data found in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small>, and viceversa.<br>
