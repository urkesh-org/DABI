<h3>Digital discourse</h3>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special way in which disparate data are appropriated, automatically and not, into the system and integrated into a meaningful new whole.
We may consider this process a <i>digital discourse</i>. Through a series of
operations that are in large measure automated, it produces <i><b>a construct
that organizes data in the form of an argument</b></i>. Its formal characteristics are
those of a narrative that serves the same purpose as the traditional one, but
with a “story line” that is construed differently – a “digital text.”

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragmentation is so characteristic of a digital text that it is valid to ask
whether we can properly speak of “discourse” (see Tilley 1990). I give
a positive answer, although it may be more appropriate to speak of <b><i>“discourses” in the plural</i></b>. Arguments are proposed and followed in a text
mode, with hyperlinks providing the equivalent of traditional crossreferences, footnotes or figures. But arguments can be constructed with
a maximum of flexibility, by following at will a myriad different threads
that are offered not at random but as part of the <i><b>larger overall discourse</b></i>.

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The great advantage of such an open-ended structure is <i><b>the speed with
which one can follow an unlimited quantity of path</b></i>s that link with each
other the most varied observations. In so doing, randomness can become
purposeful.

<td valign=top>disadvantages</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must, however, caution against the disadvantages. A digital discourse can reduce to a minimum the time for reflection and the <i><b>ability to
absorb both arguments and data</b></i>. Also, the <i><b>perception of the whole</b></i> is
quite different between a digital and a printed text, and so are the
modalities of use. Therefore one may easily lose track of the broader
import and one may as a result drown in details. In that case, randomness
may generate a purposeless daydreaming. Thus it may be useful to
encourage the notion that one should in fact “read” and “study,” not
just “surf,” a digital text (on cognitive implications of multimedia learning, see Mayer 2005)

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “digital narrative” refers to the <i><b>nexus among the components of
the discourse</b></i>, or the style whereby an argument is being pursued in
explicitly digital terms (see also literary digital narrative, Ryan 2002).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The term “digital discourse” refers to the <i><b>overall frame within which an
argument unfolds</b></i>, or the span that is seen as constituting a structural whole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The term “digital text” refers to the <i><b>specific embodiment in which
discourse and narrative take shape</b></i>, a self-contained structural whole such
as a full website, or a digital book or monograph contained within it (see
Chapter 12).</b></i>.

<td width=100 valign=top>"One long argument"</td>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the
reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated” – thus
reads the first sentence of the last (15th) chapter of The Origin of Species
(Darwin 1861: 492). The same words are repeated at the end of Darwin’s
Autobiography: “The Origin of Species is one long argument from the
beginning to the end” (Darwin 1958: 140; note also the title of Mayr 1991).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does any author feel this way in constructing a website? Do readers expect
it? Not as a rule, it would seem. We do not expect a website to unfold as [page 216] a major single argument, nor do we typically plan on developing an argument
while “writing” a website. There does not seem to be a particular concern to
achieve a logical concatenation among the parts so that, through the progression of the conceptual flow, the underlying secret kinship might emerge
“from the beginning to the end,” as Darwin would have it. There seems to be
no room for pride in constructing “one long argument” (see also Carr 2008).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is, of course, a coherence of subject matter and a sense of harmony
in the display: in this sense, the compositional unity of a website is entrusted
essentially to its design, understood primarily as an aesthetic dimension.
Conceptually, a website may remain primarily a repository, a clearing
house for elements that remain often only extrinsically related to each
other. If instead of an aggregate resulting from accumulation we wish to
achieve an organic whole, an effective overarching frame within which the
arguments unfold, we must think of it in terms of a digital discourse. What
are the principles that can make such a conceptual unity possible? This
is the topic of this section, where I will seek to describe a digital text
(a website) in terms of discourse analysis as found in linguistics. I will
then look at the impact this has on perception (12.5) and at the specific
mechanisms through which these principles may be applied (12.6).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We must first consider briefly the relationship between a digital discourse seen as a “long argument” and the nature of a simple digital
argument as discussed earlier (11.3). In both instances we look at sequentiality, but from a different point of view. When talking about an argument as
such, we look from within at the dynamics through which data and
inferences are ordered sequentially: what is the nature of the possible
linkages among them? Our focus is then on sequentiality in act, on the
consequentiality of the steps. When talking instead about a digital discourse
(the long argument), we look from without at the sequence as a selfcontained span, something that derives its coherence from the nature of
the trajectory that has a given starting point and an ending.
