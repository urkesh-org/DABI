<h3>Digital humanities</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current meaning of "digital" humanities is weighted heavily, we might even say exclusively, in the direction of the <a href="systems.htm">information</a> system. When speaking of <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a>, the term remains ambiguous: the term "digital" can be taken in a (grammatically) subjective sense, whereby it is digitality that defines thought; or it can be taken in a (grammatically) objective sense, whereby thought is seen to control digitality. The term "digital humanities," on the other hand, is unambiguous: it implies and exclusively subjectuve sense of the adjectiuve "digital." Here the emphasis is on <i><b>how digital technique can be applied from the outside</b></i> to material that is known to fit within the humanities.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term has replaced the one that was current in the early years: <i><b>"computer applications in the humanities."</b></i> The term "digital humanities" that has replaced it is more elegant, apart from the fact that the term "apps" has become a neologism, easily borrowed in other languages, to refer to a much wider range of fields. But in some ways, the term "digital humanities" is deceptive. If more modest, the old term was in some ways more suited to express what was intended.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To betetr understand the problem, we may compare thye term with another such as <i><b>"photographic humanities"</b></i>. This would refer to the best way in which photography can reproduce items that belong in the humanities, such as texts or art works. We are speaking of course of <i>digital</i> photography, but the emphasis is entirely on the final output: how high  resolution can render shsdes of a painting; how proper lighting might show to its best advantage the surface of a cuneiform tablet; how x-ray fluorescence imaging might bring out hidden details of a palimpsest; and  so on. The painting, the tablet, the palimpsest belong in hte humaninties, and photography is the instrument that is "applied" to them.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in thsi way that the term "digital humanities" is understood, and it is as such that it has become <i><b>solidly entrenched in academia</b></i>, with vast resources being put in its service. It is a most worthwhile, indeed indispensable, approach to techniques, given especially the ever greater technical complexity of the medium that is being used. But it has blinded us to the impact it has been having on our conceptual view of digitality. <br>

<h3>Digital humanism </h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use the term "digital humanism" to refer to <i><b>the primacy of humanism over digitality</b></i>. This understanding rests on criteria that are applicable more specifically to <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposal is to go beyond this limited understanding and to implement <i><b>the wider frame of a <a href="discourse.htm"><a href="">"digital discourse"</a></b></i>.<br>

<br>

Concpetually, the analog modality is related to a humanistic search for experience<br>
the digital modality is related to teh social sciences search for epoche'<br>
digitsal discourse aims to bring the two together: <u><i><b>a third modality</b></i></u>?<br>

<h3>A personal note &#8211; institutional</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my <i><b>academic career</b></i>, I have actively straddled both domains, the humanities and the social sciences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came to UCLA, in 1965, I was formally and effectively in <i><b>both divisions</b></i>, through my being on the faculty in the Department of Near Eastern Languages (as it was called the; it changed its name, later, to Near Eastern Languages and Cultures), and in the Department of History. I had a very active role in both departments, leading a number of students in both departments to their M.A. and PhD. degrees as I have outlined in my personal website (<a href="http://www.giorgiobuccellati.net">giorgiobuccellati.net)</a>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly because of my institutional involvement in both divisions, as well as because of my lilnks of collegiality with colleauges equally involved in both divisions, I was charged with the task of establishing the <i><b>Institute of Archaeology</b></i>, which came to fruition in 1973 (it became subsequently the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology).When I was asked for a recommendation as to where the Institute should be house, my preference was for the Social Sciences, and so it has been, to this day.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My choice was based on more than just the need to implement an institutional formality. At that point in time, two factors in particular prompted me to opt for the social sciences.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, a number of colleagues were actively engaged in new ways of looking at archaeology and history from <i><b>a theoretical point of view</b></i>, especially in the Anthropology Department (Lewis Binford had been briefly at UCLA); and in the History Department with towering figures like Lynn White who also, if in different ways, looked at historical process in terms of material culture, and (for a brief period) Hayden White, who brought into focus the relationship between values and historical process.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other, the <i><b>sensitivity for the digital medium</b></i> was more forcefully present and adapted to Social Sciences interests, and were being so applied, especially with regard to statistics. This was precisely in line with the emphasis on <a href="systems.htm">information</a> as the system to articulate and present data, which has remained the dominant mode in the (appropriately named) "information technology" (IT) field.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>stated goal of the Institute</b></i> was to bring together in a constructive dialog all the energy in creative thinking of which the UCLA archaeology community was so rich. This goal was achieved in many ways, but not in the sense of "humanizing" the digital trend &#8211; which is what I am arguing for in this website.<br>

<h3>A personal note &#8211; conceptual</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became <i><b>actively involved with the digital dimension</b></i> since the very early days of my tenure at UCLA &#8211; beginning as early as 1965 with the mainframe computer, where the input was sitll only through punched tape or punched cards, and the output through enormous fanfold printouts. My first office as Director of the Institute of Arhcseology was in the Math Science building, next to where the mainframe was housed &#8211; the computer being at the time a complex of very delicate hardware, with which we interfaced through a slot in the wall. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition to mini-computers first and then to desktop computers gave a greater sense of familiarity with the machine, and encouraged me to take up <i><b>programming</b></i>. From an early exposure to assembly language I went on to a variety of prepackaged database and statistical programs and to a variety of BASIC languages. This reduced the distance from the machine not only in a physical, but also in a psychological sense. It guided my effort at controlling not only the input and the output (so symbolically represented by the boxes of cards turned in outside the computer room in the evening, and the output coming out the following morning through a slot in the wall) but also what went on between the two. It served a good purpose in producing a viable system in the processing of excavation data. But even more importantly it gave me an insight into the nature of data "processing." It is the interface that interweaves data dynamically, and thus resembles the argument: what is the nature of this process?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My direct programming efforts ended  by 2010: I felt I had established the needed parameters, within which the programs I had written functioned quite well and produced the desired results. I felt that the task should be handed over to professional programmers who could upgrade the system to work in the new platforms. But by then I had come to <i><b>view the digital "humanities" from within</b></i>, gaining a greater sense of understanding for what the medium entailed, not so much in terms of its enormous potential, but rather and especially in terms of how it fits within the architecture of human knowledge. Having touched first hand the <i>technique</i> that made it function, I became more alert to the <i>method</i> that gave the function a sense of direction. Thus it was that I became more sensitive to what is, in many ways, a return to the origins &#8211; what was behind and thus in fonrt of the "humanities."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="thought.htm#consciousness">Distance and closeness</a> emerged for me in the first person &#8211; and they brought me to a reconsideration of <i><b>what digital "humanism" really is and what it can ultimately accomplisch</b></i>. Hence the views expressed in this website. The personal stimulus was the distance of a self-reflection that looked at the technique from without, with a degree, however limited, of insight into its functioning. And it was at the same time the closeness of finding the need for a human experience which could be <i>served by</i>, instead of being <i>controlled by</i>, the technique itself.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against the background of this personal history that the emphasis, in this website, on a <i><b>restructurred epistemology</b></i> may be best understood. Digital thought is the best expression of humanism, and to the extent that it articulates our relationship to the digital process and its outputs, it shows how siginficant tits contribution can be. As at other points in our intellectual history, humanism, in its deeper understanding of digitality, can affect our understading of the social and the exact sciences. It does so by alerting us to the value and the limit of fragmentation, and to other means of control besides those based on numerical quantification.<br>

<h3><i>Les adieux</i></h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting back on the concepts that underiie the 4banks.net project, I will set here next to each other two quotes (Socrates in Plato, <i>Phaedrus</i> 266b and the chorus in Aeschylus, <i>Agamemnon</i> 176-183) that in some way summarize the two main <a href="systems.htm">systems</a> &#8211; the digital aiming to control fragmentation and the analog aiming to face the whole.<br>
