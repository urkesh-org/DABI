<i>The phrase "<b><i>Four River Banks</i></b>" was introduced around 2200 B.C.<br>
by Naram-Sin, king of Akkad, to refer to what we call Mesopotamia.<br>
The latter is a Greek term and concept ("land between the rivers")<br>
which was alien to the ancients who lived there.<br>
<br>
"Four river banks" refers to the <b>two banks of the Tigris and of the Euphrates respectively</b>,<br>
the "bank" being the starting point of the irrigation system<br>
which characterized the territory from the middle course of the rivers down to the Gulf.<br>
The term was introduced by Naram-Sin to refer to the new political reality<br>
which his gandfather, Sargon, had started to implement and he had consolidated.</i>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4banks.net is the <b><i>hub of a cluster of six websites</i></b> dedicated to five complementary aspects of Mesopotamian civilization: language, history, literature, art and religion; one more website deals with methodological issues. As such it serves as a portal that brings together the websites, an entry way that shows their commonality and interrelationship.<br>
