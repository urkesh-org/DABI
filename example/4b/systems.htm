<h3>Digital text</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face value meaning of the term "digital text" refers to its being presented in an <i><b>electronic</b></i> rather than a a paper embodiment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use it in a more restricted sense, to refer to its <i><b>conceptual structure</b></i>: it is a text that is conceived and realized with a fluidity and elasticity that is not possible in a paper format. As simple photographic copy of a printed page displayed on a screen as a copy of the printed page (e.g., in a .JPG format) is digital only in a relative sense, i. e., as referring to the physical medium (the screen) rather than its conceptual consistency (such as searchability and hyperlinking).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we consider <i><b>two types of digital texts</b></i> as being properly "digital," databases and narrative websites. A para-digital format includes other formats that are digital in an electronic, but not in a conceptual, sense.<br>

<h3>The notion of epistemological system</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An epistemological system aims <i><b>to organize and to communicate knowledge</b></i>. A lecture, an article, a book are concrete realizations of such a system: with different degrees of depth, detail, documentation, they propose a unified view of a given issue. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A system combines theory and practice</b></i> by addressing the question as to what configuration knowledge can take when embodied in a particular form. It is what the notion of <i>publishing</i> envisages. Lectures, articles, books are prime examples of this embodiment, and it is readily apparent how they achieve their goal. It is useful to clarify what exactly is meant by <a href="epistemology.htm">epistemology</a> in general, and in particular how it emerges in the various forms in which it takes shape.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is less clear what the full <i><b>epistemological potential of a website</b></i> might be, in comparison to the standard channels used in scholarship (lectures or printed materials). In what way does a website serve epistemology? It is the issue that concerns us here.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, <i><b>a website is a valid epistemological locus</b></i> on a par with, and even more than, established publication channels. But in current practice it falls short of its full potential. It has taken over the distinction between data and narrative, present in these channels, but in the process it has exacerbated the distinction, and effectively ignored the narrative dimension.<br>

<h3>The split into two systems</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic targets of an epistemological system, depending on <i><b>whether one organizes data or one constructs an argument</b></i>. The two are closely interrelated: data presuppose an argument that defines and categorizes them (they are not assembled haphazardly), and an argument draws on evidence (the data) to support its conclusions. In this regard, data and argument are part (as subsystems) of one and the same system.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, however, they often become <i><b>two separate systems</b></i>. Thus, a dictionary or the critical edition of text can be seen as examples of a system that favors data organization. A discursive essay or a novel, on the other hand, are examples of an argument that develops a narrative thread with minimal reference to evidence.<br>

<a name=syndrome></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The split into two systems has indeed sharpened with the advent of digitality. We may speak of a <i><b>data information syndrome</b></i>, meaning that total priority has been given to the data oriented system. While it presupposes an argument, it does not do so explicitly, and as a result the digital dimension of the argument becomes atrophied. This phenomenon has been studied from a cognitive point of view, i. e., as it relates to the subject of knoweldge, the human mind. Here we want to study the phenomenon from an epistemological point ofd view, i. e., as it relates to the system of knowledge itself.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look here at <i><b>how current websites structure <a href="data.htm">data</a> and <a href="narrative.htm">narrative</a></b></i>, seen as separate entities, as they result from the split in the basic system. This is a formal analysis that pays particular attention to the epistemological dimension. I will also show how the <a href="text.htm">digital text</a> as we find it in current practice falls short of adequately exploiting the power of the medium.<br>

<h3>Digital discourse as a newly unified system</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At variance with what happens with websites in current practice, I propose that a website can serve as a more powerful epistemological tool capable of <i><b>recombining data and argument into a unified digital system</b></i>. It is an effort that requires a recalibration of how we think about websites, a recalibration that is made possible by the notion of <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, in terms not so much of the technique to be used, as rather of the <a href="deep.htm">deep structure</a> that underlies the system.<br>

<h3>Two formats</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we consider <i><b>two types of digital texts</b></i> as being properly "digital," databases and narrative websites. A para-digital format includes other formats that are digital in an electronic, but not in a conceptual, sense.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>digital organization of data and narratives</b></i> takes shape in two configurations, which normally have a limited correlation with each other. A database presents the data in juxtaposition to each other, without a connecting thread, while a narrative gives this thread and refers back to the data in an ad hoc fashion. In the 4banks websites both databases and narratives take on a different outlook.<br>
