<h3>"Out of the norm"</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is <i><b>out of the norm</b></i> to even imagine that a website may have a <a href="synergy.htm#closure">conclusion</a>, partly because it typically remains constantly in flux, but more importantly because it is not generally conceived and constructed as a <a href="discourse.htm#concept">compositional whole</a>. Precisely because I make instead a case for the need to <a href="discourse.htm#writing">write a website</a> with that goal in mind, I wish to enter here some reflections, in hindsight, about how I think that goal has been achieved in 4banks.net.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Conclusion</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>The epistemological dimension</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central goal was to <i><b>explain the nature of the websites</b></i> that are comprised within the cluster <a href="https://www.4banks.net" target=blank>4banks.net</a>. I did not intend to describe the content matter of each website, something that is made sufficiently clear by the title of each. It was rather to show how the very concept of a website is best suited to serve a specific scholarly communication aim.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, I set out to articulate (in Parts 1 and 2) the specific digital dimension that constitutes a <i><b>properly structured scholarly website</b></i>, with particular reference to the notions of digital discourse and digital thought, which are at the core of the whole enterprise. <a href="discourse.htm">Digital discourse</a> is conceived as an entity with an <a href="systems.htm">epistemological status</a> of its own, one that combines data and argument in an integrated whole, with a special <a href="synergy.htm">synergy</a> between the analog and the digital sides of the equation. <a href="thought.htm">Digital thought</a>, on the other hand, refers to how digitality adds a new dimension to the human ability to relate to reality, in ways that are in contrast with the goals of artificial intelligence.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established this as my main goal, I then showed <i><b>how the websites in the cluster revolve around this central premise</b></i>, in terms of the two main aims, substantive (Part 3) and methodological (Part 4).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By following this goal of creating a new kind of (scholarly) website, new insights emerged into the digital potential for <i><b>articulating and communicating knowledge</b></i>. Thus I could see how the <a href="thought.htm#impact">epistemological import</a> of the 4banks.net proposal could reach deeper than it seemed at first: properly understood, digital discourse can be seen to truly reconfigures in a new way our stance vis-&agrave;-vis knowledge<br>

<h3>The cognitive impact</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My aim to create a scholarly website was, <a href="history-p.htm">from the beginning</a>, meant as a practical endeavor. In the process, its theoretical import became clearer. The attempt at creating a properly structured digital discourse turned out to meet head on the challenge posed, by browser based texts, to the notion of <a href="humanities UTF.htm#deep"><i><b>deep reading</b></i></a>. Establishing an organic multi-layered structure emerged as an answer questions relating to the impact that the internet as a whole is beginning to have on our mindsets: properly understood, I came to see more and more how <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a> enhances our cognitive skills, which can otherwise be dulled. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the reflections about <a href="synergy.htm">synergy</a>, a website based on digital discourse will be <i><b>accessed concurrently in its bimodal dimension</b></i>. It deserves being "read" from cover to cover while at the same time it can be "browsed" segmentally. In the process, I came to see how this provided a different, but deeply valid, understanding of deep reading.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is,in fact, a wholly new way of understanding what reading deeply or, if you will, <i><b>reading "from cover to cover"</b></i> means. It does mean studying the digital discourse in its wholeness, but usgin new ways of internalizing the core argument. This argument is presented in a formal multiplicity, drawing on multiple expressive layers, tightly interlaced among themselves. Getting the sense of this multi-layered whole is the cognitive enterprise we must engage in.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it is that this effort brought out for me more clearly, and unexpectedly, the <i><b>impact that humanism can have on the social sciences</b></i>. It is a different view of what the ultimate goal of  <a href="humanities UTF.htm">"digital humanities"</a> should be: the urge and the ability to seek out and relate to the whole, not in spite of, but rather through its very structural complexity as an aggregate, is what humanism brings to the digital mindset. While keeping digital humanities, we must progress to <a href="humanities UTF.htm#discourse">digital humanism</a>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>This particular hub website</b></i> is very simple in terms of formal multiplicity, because it is relatively short in size, minimal in its recourse to multiple arguments, and without any dependence on databases. But I did contruct ("write") it with a clear intent to achieve a full interplay of the two dimensions, analog and digital. I trust it can lend itself well to experimenting what I consider a <a href="systems.htm#integration">new epistemological system</a>.<br>

<h3><i>In a personal vein</i>...</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote this <a href="overview.htm">hub website</a> in a personal vein, very much in the first person. One will see this especially in my review of the <a href="history-p.htm">long history</a> of the project, and in the even more <a href="humanities.htm#personal">personal reflections</a> about my career and conceptual development in this regard. But throughout there is a presonal tone as one does not generally find in websites that tend to be rather anonymous and anodyne.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I close on an equally personal tone with the  <i><b>approximation of an envoi</b></i> &#8211; borrowed from Petrarch (<i>Canzoniere</i> XL 5-8):<br>
<br>
