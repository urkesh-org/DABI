<h3>Three perspectives</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Websites have become fully entrenched in our practice, but <i><b>little critical thought has gone into an analysis of what the nature of a website is</b></i>. The question is interesting in itself, but is particularly important when considering websites as serving a scholarly purpose. To this end, we will look at a website from three perspectives, which are not mutually exclusive but, potentially at least, complementary. Only some os these perspectives apply to websites currently in use; the others are the ones I am here arguing for.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Websites</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>1. The informational perspective</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Websites are universally seen as informational in nature: they convey the most diverse variety of <i><b>representations of facts and ideas</b></i>. The gathering of these representations into a website is open-ended (hence the dotted line of the frame in Fig. 1), and the degree of authorial responsilbity and critical weight is extremely fluid and generally very limited.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On aspect that is universally associated with most websites currently in use is <i><b>a marked sense of urgency</b></i> (<a name="urgency1"></a><a href="#urgency2"><sup>urgency</sup></a>). It is, for the most part, a fabricated sense of urgency. While information does certainly convey knowledge, what seems to matter most, in current websites, is the rapidity with which that knowledge is made available and the size of the audience it reaches. Here lies the deeper (and mist threatening) meaning of McLuhan's ditto "the medium is the message."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis is not on the content, on knowledge as such, but rather on the <i><b>spread factor</b></i>. The very term "information" implies that one is bent on shaping ("forming") the target, rather than on focusing on the intrinsic value of what is presented. In this regard, "information" can become antithetical to "communication," which implies sharing a value, something that stands by itself regardless of whom it reaches, or how rapidly.<br>

<h3>2. The epistemological perspective</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>An epistemological <mark>construct/instrument</mark></b></i> is a channel for structuring and conveying knowledge. A website is an ideal vehicle to this end, first and foremost because it allows us to combine the <a href="systems.htm">two systems</a> (data and narrative) into a unified argument, in ways that are not possible in a paper format. But this merging into what I call a digital discourse is not generally implemented in current websites, and here I will make a case for this understanding of the nature of a website.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An epistemological perspective is <i><b>symmetrically opposed to the informational perspective</b></i>  because it places the emphasis on the knowledge content <a name="knowledge1"></a><sup><a href="#knowledge2">knowledge</a></sup>, without any sense of urgency. Knowledge is presented for its own sake, not for the impact it may have on the audience. This sense of distance makes for a more objective and dispassionate representation of facts and arguments.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two epistemological <a href="systems.htm">subsystems</a> impact directly on the character of websites, and so we have <i><b>two parallel types</b></i>, noe that is oriented towards dazta, and another that is oriented to the argument.<br>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Data oriented websites</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data oriented websites are in current common use, and they come in two major categories.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may be <i><b>in the form of <a href="data.htm#tabularity">tabular databases</a></b></i><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other data oriented websites are in the form of an <i><b>ordered publication of data</b></i><br>

<h3>3. The literary analysis perspective</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A literary construct</b></i> is a  linguistic entity that has a consistency of its own, with a formal and substantive coherence that holds the parts together. Websites are not generally considered in this category, because they are seen primarily as serving a utilitarian purpose, like a catalog or at best a dictionary. I will here make instead the case for their proper literary dimension.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If epistemology places the emphasis on the knowledge content, it does not ignore the importance of how it is presented. In other words, it is not that, because of its neutrality vis-&agrave;-vis the audience it ignores it. The issue of communication is still very much in foreground, and must be considered on its own grounds. It is in this regard that a website becomes the object of a critical literary analysis, botn in termns of how it is to be construed and how it is to be accessed.<br>

<h3>The notion of website</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I focus on the notion of the website seen as a literary construct and an epistemological instrument.<br>

<mark>epistemological dimension is actually the one in current use, but limited to data<br>
not the literary diension, i. e., no link to te argument<br>

<h3>Nature and structure</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Websites are so ubiquitous nowadays that it may seem pointless ot <i><b>inquire about their nature and structure</b></i>. But such too facile an acceptance of what a website purports to be has led, in my view, to an underappreciation of its potential for scholarly communication. Going against the mainstream, the present discussion is intended to bear this out. As indicated, I aim to show how a website can be a literary construct and serve as an epistemological locus. Now, this task may be considered futile &#8211; on the grounds that there is not sufficient substance to warrant such an effort. Or else, where one concedes that there is some literary and epistemological depth to be seen in a website, the inquiry I am proposing may seem unnecessary &#8211; on the grounds that the nature and purpose of a website are obvious. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justify my view, we will look critically into a website's nature and structure. In principle, this analysis obtains for any and all websites. In fact, however, the major points raised here, concerning their literary and epistemological dimension, are <i><b>present only potentially or, at best, embryonically in standard current websites</b></i>. To illustrate this point, we should distinguish between two basic types of websites, which are to be seen as complementary.

<h3>Two types</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A standard website is conceived as a container</b></i>, i. e., as a receptacle that contains a variable number of items. It is open ended, without an overriding sense of the whole that constitutes the content. The items are related to each other on the basis of external criteria, much as the alphabetical sequence determines the assemblage of items in a dictionary; thus they do not constitute an organic sequence that derives its unity from within, they are juxtaposed on the basis of external criteria.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, <i><b>a website based on the notion of digital discourse is conceived as a whole from within</b></i>. It, too, serves as a container, a receptacle that contains a variable number of items. But these have a coherence of their own, one that constitutes a self-contained and organic whole. Thus, while standard websites stop at the level of the container, the website I am proposing is one that goes beyond that level while at the same time including it in its own make-up.<br>

<h3>Digital container and digital discourse</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A standard website is conceived as a container</b></i>, i. e. as a receptacle that contains a variable number of items. It is open ended, without an overriding sense of the whole that consitutes the content.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A discourse type website is conceived as a whole from within</b></i>: it, too, is a receptacle that contains a variable number of itmes, but these have a coherence of their own, that constitute a self-contained whole<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the two types of website is conditioned by two major factors: tyhe nature of the boundaries and the nature of the interlacing.<br>
<br>
<i><b>1. The nature of the boundaries of the website</b></i>:
<ul>
  <li>in the container type website, the boundaries of the container are determined from the outside, by the nature of the container, not by the coherence of the whole inside;</li>
  <li>in a discourse type website, by contrast, the boundaries are determined by the coherence of the whole:</li>
</ul>

</center>
<br>


<i><b>2. The nature of the interlacing with other layers</b></i>:
<ul>
    <li>in the container type website, interlacing among layers is at the level of the segment, not of the layers qua layers;</li>
  <li>in the discourse type, by cnotrast, interlacing is between whole layers qua layers, and it is reciprocal:</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>see also undre <a href="narrative.htm#browser">narrative</a><br>
The <i><b>structural distinctiveness of a browser edition</b></i> as implemented in our websites lies in the way in which multiple narratives and multiple data sets are constructed in parallel, so as to complement each other systemically. The full argument emerges only from the dynamic concurrence of these many layers, and depends on all of them at once. This full argument is what I call a <a href="discourse.htm">digital discour</mark>se</a>. <br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will illustrate the traits of the website understood as digital sicourse in juxtaposition with those of the website understood as a digital container<br>

<h3>Configuration: surface structure</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of surface structure refers to <i><b>the <a href="configuration.htm">formal configuration</a> that a website takes:</b></i> it is the concrete and tangible form in which it is displayed on the screen, but seen from a conceptual point of view. It is not the aesthetic aspect that is of concern here, but rather the proportional weight of the various components as they affect our perception of the website seen as a coherent whole.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration of a website deals with the way in which<i><b> the display is organized and accessed as an epistemological channel</b></i>. In other words, what is at stake is the way in which knowledge is conceived and presented so as to make its communication clear and effective.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><small>Back to top: <a href="#0"><b>Websites</b></a></small></small></a><br>
<h3>Frame: deep structure</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of deep structure refers to the way in which multiple formal layers are interlaced with each other. I use the notion of "frame" to refer to the nature of this <br>
stratifed<br>
different from multi-tasking: layers are interlaced, co-present, converging, whereas in multi-tasking they are juxtaposed<br>
 It is a complex task, which I subsume under the concept of <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>. It requires special attention and care, both in <a href="uses.htm">writing and reading</a> a website, and once implemented it discloses the full potential of a website in light of the goal I am aiming for, i. e., the website as an indeal epistemological channel.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is especially in the case of deep structure that <i><b>current websites fail to realize the full potential of the medium</b></i>. The reason is that, while <a href="hyperlinks.htm#conceptual">hyperlinks</a> do effectively and efficiently interlace layers (i. e., the various pages and websites on which they call), they do not see the layers qua layers: the hyperlinks are rather anecdotal, in the sense that they draw on information whose meaning is exhausted in the fragment. It is a segmented, rather than a systemic interlacing.<br> -->
