<h3>Digital text</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face value meaning of the term "digital text" refers to its being presented in an <i><b>electronic</b></i> rather than a a paper embodiment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use it in a more restricted sense, to refer to its <i><b>conceptual structure</b></i>: it is a text that is conceived and realized with a fluidity and elasticity that is not possible in a paper format. As simple photographic copy of a printed page displayed on a screen as a copy of the printed page (e.g., in a .JPG format) is digital only in a relative sense, i. e., as referring to the physical medium (the screen) rather than its conceptual consistency (such as searchability and hyperlinking).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we consider <i><b>two types of digital texts</b></i> as being properly "digital," databases and narrative websites. A para-digital format includes other formats that are digital in an electronic, but not in a conceptual, sense.<br>

<h3>Two formats</h3>-->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>digital organization of data and narratives</b></i> takes shape in two configurations, which normally have a limited correlation with each other. A database presents the data in juxtaposition to each other, without a connecting thread, while a narrative gives this thread and refers back to the data in an ad hoc fashion. In the 4banks websites both databases and narratives take on a different outlook.<br>

<h3>Database</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A database is generally understood to be <i><b>tabular in nature</b></i>: the cells are juxtaposed within a matrix that spells out the parameters for each row and column, according to categorization systems that can be very complex. A database as such does not develop an argument, since cells to not explicilty refer to each other and thus do not develop a sequential and ifnerential thread that leads to any possible conclusion. In its simplest format, a tabular database can be schematically rendered as follows:<br>
<br>
<center><img src="images/database links to the outside.jpg" height=190 valign=middle border="0" alt=""><br>
Fig. 1</center><br>
where, if look at cell 4b, the content (<b>X</b>) presupposes contents (Y and Z) in the adjacent cells, but does not in and of itself lead to them. Thus there is a an implied argument (the <a href="thought.htm#data">categorization system</a> that puts in relation X with Y and Z), but there is no explicit thread that links X, Y and Z, much less one that draws any conclusions from it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4banks websites do not have tabular databases (except in a limited way in the indices), but the <a href="structure.htm#configuration">R<small>ECORD</small> section</a> (Part II) of each website is in effect the<i><b> conceptual equivalent of a (tabular) database</b></i>. The information is presented without a narrative thread that links the various items.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, <i><b>each item in the database has explicit links</b></i> to various other narrative layers (the arrows to the outside) and within the items themselves (arrow between X and Z). This gives a special dynamic dimension to our databases, one that helps actualize in new ways the full potential of the digital medium.<br>

<h3>Narrative</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A narrative website is a text formatted as a <i><b>browser edition</b></i>: it is conceived as natively digital, and is not a printed text that has been digitized, whether as a photographic image or as a searchable text.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narratives are <i><b>threads presenting a linear argument</b></i>. As schematically shown in Figure 2, a given narrative A unfolds the argument through successive steps a, b,c, etc., and for any given step (such as c or d) it draws on a concurrent argument presented in a parallel narrative, and it draws ss well (as in step f) on data that are found in a similarly concurrent database.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="images/narrative.jpg" width=700 valign=middle border="0" alt=""><br>
Fig. 2</center><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formalization I use proposes <i><b>a SEGMENTED narrative, with emphasis on "segmented."</b></i> Each segment (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, etc.) corresponds to a short section defined by a title (as with the title "Narrative" for this section), which is further subdivided into short paragraphs, each with higlighted keywords. There is <a href="thought.htm#discourse">no categorization system</a> that defines parameters for these sections or paragraphs, so their various correlations are activated by hyperlinks and by the studying of the website. On the other hand, sections and paragraphs are intentionally short, so that each incorporates a single central idea. What makes the digital narratives a part of the digital discourse is the fact that the narratives are natively constructed as being parallel, and can be expected to be so (i. e., parallel) by the reader.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is at the same time a <i><b>segmented NARRATIVE, with emphasis on "narrative"</b></i> with its own coherent flow. This is indicated graphically by the arrows that define both the directionality of the argument and the sequential correlation of the segments: <b>b</b> makes sense because it comes after <b>a</b> and before <b>c</b>.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 4banks websites, <i><b>multiple narratives</b></i> are found in Part I,  the <a href="structure.htm#configuration">A<small>RGUMENT</small> section</a>, and they engage digitally with each other as discussed in the section on <a href="discourse structure.htm">digital discourse</a>. While each narrative is unilinear in an of itself, it invokes multilinearity and depends on it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One limitation in the first version of the websites is that the core narrative is in fact represented by a <i><b>non-digital narrative</b></i>, a printed book. This is due to the the nature of the formation process through which the <a href="history-p.htm#early">project has matured</a>; in <a href="archives.htm">subsequent versions</a>, the core narrative will be fully digital.

<h3>Para-digital</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In current parlance, the term "digital" is used in ways that reflect only in part the modalities here outlined. Of particular interest to us is the digital transfer of a paper publication in a .PDF format. This is indeed <i><b>digital in the technical sense</b></i> that it relies on the translation of the paper format into digits that can be assembled by the computer for a display practially identical to that of the paper version. As a result there is also the advantage of searchability which is missing in the analog dimension.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the <i><b>other aspects of a digital dimension are missing</b></i>, and to emphasize this difference I use the term "para-digital," in a way that is similar to that which one find, for instance, in the term "para-medic" as opposed to a properly medical doctor.<br>
