<h3>Digital humanities</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current meaning of "digital" humanities is weighted heavily, we might even say exclusively, in the direction of the <a href="systems.htm">information</a> system. 
<br>
Concpetually, the analog modality is related to a humanistic search for experience<br>
the digital modality is related to teh social sciences search for epoche'<br>
digitsal discourse aims to bring the two together: <u><i><b>a third moddality</b></i></u>?<br>
digital humanities understood not as synthesis, but as appiction

<h3>Digital humanism </h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposal is to go beyond this limited understanding and to implement the wider frame fo a <a href="https://critique-of-ar.net/Notes/12.htm#12.4">digital discourse</a><br>

<h3>A personal note &#8211; institutional</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my academic career, I have actively straddled both domains, the humanities and the social sciences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came to UCLA, in 1965, I was formally and effectively in both divisions, through my being on the faculty in the Department of Near Eastern Languages (as it was called the; it changed its name, later, to Near Eastern Languages and Cultures), and in the Department of History. I had a very active role in both departments, leading a number of students in both departments to their M.A. and PhD. degrees as I have outlined in my personal website (<a href="http://www.giorgiobuccellati.net">giorgiobuccellati.net)</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly because of my institutional involvement in both divisions, as well as because of my lilnks of collegiality with colleauges equally involved in both divisions, I was charged with the task of establishing the Institute of Archaeology, which came to fruition in 1973 (it became subsequently the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology).When I was asked for a recommendation as to where the Institute should be house, my preference was for the Social Sciences, and so it has been, to this day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My choice was based on more than just the need to implement an institutional formality. At that point in time, two factors in particular prompted me to opt for the social sciences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, a number of colleagues were actively engaged in new ways of looking at archaeology and history from a theoretical point of view, especially in the Anthropology Department (Lewis Binford had been briefly at UCLA); and in the History Department with towering figures like Lynn White who also, if in different ways, looked at historical process in terms of material culture, and (for a brief period) Hayden White, who brought into focus the relationship between values and historical process.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other, the sensitivty for the digital medium was more forcefully present and adapted to Social Sciences interests, and were being so applied, especially with regard to statistics. This was precisely in line with the emphasis on <a href="systems.htm">information</a> as the system to articulate and present data, which has remained the dominant mode in the (appropriately named) "information technology" (IT) field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated goal of the Institute was to bring together in a constructive dialog all the energy in creative thinking of which the UCLA archaeology community was so rich. This goal was achieved in many ways, but not in the sense of "humanizing" the digital trend &#8211; which is what I am arguing for in this website.<br>

<h3>A personal note &#8211; conceptual</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanities can make an essential contribution in reshaping our understanding of the full digital potential of the medium, effectively restructuring our epistemology.<br>
linguistics - assembly language; archeoogy computers;<br>
ironically, distance thruogh humanism<br>
