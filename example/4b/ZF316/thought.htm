<h3>The concept</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its current use, the term "digital thought" is understood with the adjective "digital" taken in a (grammatically) subjective sense: the phrase refers then to <i><b>a digital medium as a subject that thinks</b></i>. The primacy of digitality is here affirmed, and the human subject becomes the object, the target of algorithms that control a "him" that has become a "it." It is the goal of <a href="#AI">artificial intelligence</a>. In turn, a digital thought clone is the digital twin of a live person, a robot that can closely replicate choices on the basis of known patterns exhibited by that person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the term is the exact reverse: digitality is then taken in a (grammatically) objective sense, so that the phrase refers to <i><b>a thinking human who controls digitality as the object</b></i>. The notion of control is taken in its full sense, i. e., in the sense that the value of digitality is not only fully accepted, but in fact exploited to the hilt. We may point to two ways in which this happens: <a href="#data">data bases</a> and <a href="#discourse">digital discourse</a>.<br>

<h3>Tabular data bases</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come to <i><b>rely, instinctively, on quantification</b></i>, and the trend started well before computers became common place. It has long since been insufficient to say that the weather is hot, one feels compelled to specify the degrees. To know and say that the temperature is "110&#0176; Fahrenheit" would give you a physical sense of heat, while "-10&#0176; Fahrenheit" would make you shiver.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universal use of tabular spreadsheets has accelerated this trend and has brought about a <i><b>change in our mental habits</b></i>. We rely more and more on a quantification of our daily chores, and we expect as much. A news report can hardly be credible if it is not supported by graphs summarizing data and giving percentages, to the point that we have become sensitive to even the slightest decimal change in percentages of political polls, market analysis, and so on.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also <i><b>plays an important role in scholarship</b></i>, where it is being put regularly to the best of good uses. Instead of saying that we have a large amount of data supporting a certain argument, we can indicate precisely what that amount is, and indicate the parameters that have made it possible. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is fundamental in this regard is <i><b>the categorization system which governs the definition of the pertinent parameters</b></i>. The query power of a data base is correlative to the quality of the underlying <a href="systems.htm#data_cat">categorization</a>. The effort that goes in establishing a proper grammar for the data is very much in the nature of an argument, and often a very sophisticated one at that.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However &#8211; tabular data bases are <i><b>argument driven only in a passive sense</b></i>: the argument is all in the categorization system that is upstream of the data base itself, and the relational dimension among the cells is only potential. It has to be activated by a human argument brought to bear on it from the outside, through a query function that spells out the parameters for the search.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a <a href="narrative.htm#database">tabular spreadsheet</a> an entry in any given cell is not explained by the contents of the neighboring cells. They are related in function of the categorization system which operates upstream of the data base, but they are not interacting with each other. What activates their relationship is <i><b>a query, which is in functoin of an argument brought to bear from the outside</b></i>. This (human) argument is the result of (dynamic) digital thought applied to the (static) data array. It is this argument external to the database that gives it its espitemological power.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this limited sense, data bases can be seen as <i><b>paradigmatic of digital thought</b></i>. We (as humans) bring to bear our (human) thought on data elaborated on the basis of (human) categorization, and we (humans) build an argument accordingly. It is abundantly clear that "thought" is understood as having "humans" as subject, and that the adjective "digital" refers to the object of this thought.<br>

<h3>Digital discourse</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in a <a href="discourse.htm#structure">digital discourse</a> array is more complex, because multiple and diverse layers are involved: there are parallel narratives which in turn rely on diverse databases.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layers in this multilinear array are only possible if they are construed (and read) as <a href="narrative.htm">digital narratives</a>. In a sense, the correlations shown in Fig. 2 obtain <i><b>in any form of critical thought</b></i>, whether digital or not: however, in a non-digital discourse layer <b>A</b> is the only one htat is in fact proposed and can be followed explicitly; layers B and C, as well as the data in the spreadsheet, may well be called upon, either explicitly through footnotes or appendices, or may be introduced by the readers based upon their owm knowledge. But there is no concurrence as in a digital discourse: this is the exlcusive prerogative of the digital discourse.<br>

<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <a href="#concept">indicated</a>, we tend to associate thought to digitality in a way that subsumes the former to the latter. <i><b>Artificial intelligence is the ultimate point of arrival in this trajectory</b></i>: if human thinking be seen as the process of bracing elements that are distant in reality, artificial intellgence may be seen as a set of procedures that effectively achieve the same bracing &#8211; but with pre-ordained htat are pre-ordained.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Digital thought is then the reverse of artificial intelligence</b></i>. Perhaps better, it incoporates it, because it looks at the results of the pre-ordained bracing and it braces these results it turn, following patterns of bracing that are not pre-ordained. In a sense, we may say that artificial intelligence precludes the argument at the very moment that it develops it.<br>
