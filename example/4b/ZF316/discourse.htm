<h3>The concept</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of digital discourse is at the heart of the methodological effort of the 4banks cluster of websites: it refers to the <i><b>frame wherein multiple narratives and multiple data sets are dynamically interconnected</b></i>. The notion of "frame" is particularly significant because it provides a self-imposed limit to what would otherwise remain too loose an aggregate of parts. The narratives and data sets are not juxtaposed at random, they are created concurrently (<a href="uses.htm#writing">writing</a>) and are meant to be so accessed (<a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also say that the digital discourse is a <i><b>compositional array </b></i>that holds the parts together by identifying ("framing") their reciprocal relationships. In this sense, a digital discourse entails a dynamic interaction among the constitutive parts of the "discourse," dynamic in the sense that the interaction is initiated within the discourse itself, and it invokes a new kind of human attention(<a href="uses.htm#reading">reading</a>). It requires a quantum leap in the posture vis-&agrave;-vis communication, one that is similar to what obtained when writing first came on the scene in human history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dynamism" means, in this case, that <i><b>the parts "discourse" digitally with each other</b></i>, taking the verb "to discourse" in its active sense. A hyperlink is not an anectodal and casual addition, but an integral and essential interlocutor. The parts dialog with each other, and it is the coherence of the whole that gives value to the individual components, as with the tesserae of a mosaic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, each hyperlink (the tessera) can so "dialog" with the others <i><b>only if it is seen as a component of the larger whole</b></i> (the mosaic) within which it is organically encased. Through one of its individual components, it is a whole htat is "discoursing" with other wholes. It is not a dialog between single elements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is then an ambitious undertaking, one that requires a new level of commitment to <i><b>the process through which scholarship is  constructed and communicated</b></i>. The full argument which the digital discourse unfolds rests in fact on this extreme multiplicity of layers, and depends on the development of a new kind of <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a> and of a special new posture in <a href="uses.htm">writing, reading and studying</a>.<br>

<h3>Structure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital discourse brings to its full realization the complex interaction among <a href="narrative.htm#database">data sets and narratives</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The web of relationships is very complex, and may be represented graphically in this highly simplified chart:<br>
<br>
<center><img src="images/database and discourse.jpg" width=600 valign=middle border="0" alt=""><br>
Fig. 1</center><br>
Let us take <b>A</b> as the core narrative. Steps c-d are taken from narrative B, where they occur as steps a-b, which can only fully be inderstood if they are seen in the context of all the following steps of the argument in narrative B. &#8211; The same obtains for steps f-h of narrative <b>A</b> wihch are taken from narrative D. &#8211; In turn, step i of the core narrative <b>A</b> relies on data (Y) in cell 4a from the green database which make sense only if seen in the full context of row 4 and in fact of the entire categorization of this particular (green) database. Incidentally, the content (X) in cell 4b calls for step h in narrative C for an explanation. &#8211; Finally, step d of narrative A, which is in fact step b of narrative B, relies on the full row 2 of the blue database.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>This correlation is not optional, it is necessary</b></i>. Steps c-d in the argument flow of A are borrowed dynamically from steps a-b in layer B, and similarly for steps f-h. In other words, the argument in layer A would be incomplete without the relevant portions of layers B and C, which, in turn, can only be understood when seen as steps a-b and c-e in their respective layers. We may refer to this as the sequential coordination of dynamic multilinearity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this complex web of relationships that elevates a digital dicoruse to the level of <a href="thought.htm#big">big data</a> status.

<h3>The Urkesh Global Record</h3>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4banks cluster of websites implements a relatively limited version of the concept of digital discourse. One will find a more complex, and complete, implementation in <a href="http://www.urkesh.org/record" target=blank>urkesh.org</a>, a website I have created for the Mozan/Urkesh Archaeological Project. This website applies more fully the methodological and philosophical principles presented in <a href="http://www.critique-of-AR.net/book" target=blank><i>A Critique of Archaeological Reason</i></a>.<br>
