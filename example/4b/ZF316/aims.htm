<h3>Substantive</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary aim of the Four Banks cluster of websites is substantive: the focus is on content, on the way in which data are organized, on the information they provide, on the argument that is built on them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, we study the hermeneutic process behind each of the six domains represented in the websites, aiming for a description of, and a confrontation with, the scholarship that has, over the last two centuries, documented the data and shaped our mental categories towards them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One will find a fuller description of this aim in the <i>SUBSTANTIVE</i> section of this website as shown in the side bar to the left.<br><br>

<h3>Methodological</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major collateral aim of the project is methodological: aiming to implement a special digital approach, the focus is on the method with which the data are set in relationship with each other and are then accessed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, we highlight a hidden potential aspect of digital publishing, which entails a close interlacing of the argument with the data, and viceversa.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One will find a detailed description of this aim in the <i>METHODOLOGICAL</i> section of this website as shown in the side bar to the left.<br>
