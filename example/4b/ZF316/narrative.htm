<h3>Two formats</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>digital organization of data and narratives</b></i> takes shape in two configurations, which normally have a limited correlation with each other. A database presents the data in juxtaposition to each other, without a connecting thread, while a narrative gives this thread and refers back to the data in an ad hoc fashion. In the 4banks websites both databases and narratives take on a different outlook.<br>

<h3>Database</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A database is generally understood to be <i><b>tabular in nature</b></i>: the cells are juxtaposed within a matrix that spells out the parameters for each row and column, according to categorization systems that can be very complex. A database as such does not develop an argument, since cells to not explicilty refer to each other and thus do not develop a sequential and ifnerential thread that leads to any possible conclusion. In its simplest format, a tabular database can be schematically rendered as follows:<br>
<br>
<center><img src="images/database links to the outside.jpg" height=190 valign=middle border="0" alt=""><br>
Fig. 1</center><br>
where, if look at cell 4b, the content (<b>X</b>) presupposes contents (Y and Z) in the adjacent cells, but does not in and of itself lead to them. Thus there is a an implied argument (the categorization system that puts in relation X with Y and Z), but there is no explicit thread that links X, Y and Z, much less one that draws any conclusions from it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4banks websites do not have tabular databases (except in a limited way in the indices), but the <a href="structure.htm#configuration">R<small>ECORD</small> section</a> (Part II) of each website is in effect the<i><b> conceptual equivalent of a (tabular) database</b></i>. The information is presented without a narrative thread that links the various items.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, <i><b>each item in the database has explicit links</b></i> to various other narrative layers (the arrows to the outside) and within the items themselves (arrow between X and Z). This gives a special dynamic dimension to our databases, one that helps actualize in new ways the full potential of the digital medium.<br>

<h3>Narrative</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narratives are <i><b>threads presenting a linear argument</b></i>. As schematically shown in Figure 2, a given narrative A unfolds the argument through successive steps a, b,c, etc., and for any given step (such as c or d) it draws on a concurrent argument presented in a parallel narrative, and it draws ss well (as in step f) on data that are found in a similarly concurrent database.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 4banks websites, <i><b>multiple narratives</b></i> are found in Part I,  the <a href="structure.htm#configuration">A<small>RGUMENT</small> section</a>, and they engage digitally with each other as discussed in the section on <a href="discourse structure.htm">digital discourse</a>. While each narrative is unilinear in an of itself, it invokes multilinearity and depends on it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One limitation in the first version of the websites is that the core narrative is in fact represented by a <i><b>non-digital narrative</b></i>, a printed book. This is due to the the nature of the formation process through which the <a href="history-p.htm#early">project has matured</a>; in <a href="archives.htm">subsequent versions</a>, the core narrative will be fully digital.
