<h3>A split epistemological system</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic ways in which knowledge can be organized and communicated, depending on <i><b>whether one organizes data or one constructs an argument</b></i>. The two are closely interrelated: data presuppose an argument that defines and categorizes them (they are not assembled haphazardly), and an argument draws on evidence (the data) to support its conclusions. In this regard, data and argument are part of one and the same system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, however, they often become <i><b>two separate systems</b></i>. Thus, a dictionary or the critical edition of text can be seen as examples of a system that favors data organization. A discursive essay or a novel, on the other hand, are examples of an argument that develops a narrative thread with minimal reference to evidence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The split into two systems has sharpened with the advent of digitality. We may speak of a <i><b>data information syndrome</b></i>, meaning simply that total priority has been given to the data oriented system. While it presupposes an argument, it does not do so explicitly, and as a result the digital dimension of the argument may become atrophied. It is important to assess the relative role of the two systems in this inicpient digital age, and to see how they can be recombined into the unity of a single overarching system. <br>

<h3>Data: categorization</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Data base management programs</b></i> make it feasible to create very complex arrays, ideally suited for sorts, queries, and a variety of statistical inferences that can be drawn from them. They are in universal use, and have introduced a new way to think data. In this respect they have achieved, we may say, an independent epistemological status: they shape our way to organize the "given" (the data) by adding another layer of "givenness," namely the structure within which the categorization has to take place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also say that the need for categorization guides the <i><b>conceptualization of the data</b></i>. In this sense, there is a hidden argument, as it were, which is implicit and governs the structuring of the material to be analyzed. This is upstream of the data, because it is formulated before the data are to be coded, and it reflects both the general perception of the data and the predetermined structure of the system. <br>

<h3>Data: queries</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While categorization provides an implicit argument upstream of the data base, <i><b>queries rest on arguments that are formulated downstream</b></i> of the data base, i. e., after the data base has been completed and it is open for use. In that case, since categorization is a known given, and since we use it as a starting point, an argument that is formulated outside of the data base can draw on the data in a variety of multiple combinations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a <i><b>correlation between the the two arguments</b></i>, the one upstream and the one downstream, because the power of the query is related to the power of the categorization. Categories are the nerve points that lead to clustering according to shared attributes, and can in this regard answer questions posed by the argument external to the data base, or at least they can provide material for the argument to identify an answer and proceed further with more questions.<br>

<h3>Argument: a hybrid subsystem</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both categorization and queries <i><b>the data base is passive</b></i>: the argument is either pre-existing (categorization) or is brought in from the outside (queries). The <a href="#split">data information syndrome</a> arises in this context: the data acquire an existence of their own, independent of the argument, but they lend themselves to a more dynamic set of correlations than was ever possible in a pre-digital setting: a paper version of a dictionary is certainly more passive than a relational data base that allows for multiple interconnections.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest <i><b>approximation to an integration of argument and data</b></i> is generally in the form of a digital version of a set linear text, typically a .PDF. The digital dimension of the text lies in two factors, not found in a paper edition: (1) a search function, and (2) the availability of hyperlinks. These do expand the dynamics inhernet in the text, but dos not properly contribute to the argument as such. The approximation results only in a hybrid system, still heavily weighted on the side of the data.<br>

<h3>Integration: a renewed epistemological system</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go beyond the approximation and to achieve proper integration, the argument needs to blend digitally with the data, within a single whole. The approach I follow to achieve this goal within the context of 4banks.net is in the form of a <i><b>browser edition</b></i>, which is typically housed in a website. A browser allows the creation of a proper <a href="discourse.htm">digital discourse</a>, which is an effective way of blending narrative and sources.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital discourse is thus one solution in the effort to <i><b>heal the <a href="#split">epistemological split</a></b></i>: it offers a way to implement a properly digital argument that interacts directly with the digital data base, going beyond the hybrid dimension offered by a .PDF text. The two (data and argument) are not juxtaposed, as in a hybrid system, but are instead truly "integrated," i. e., they constitute a new system of constructing and communicating knowledge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With digital discourse we create a <i><b>third epistemological system</b></i>, one that does justice to the full power of the digital medium and shows at the same time the deeper impact of <a href="thought.htm">digital thought</a>.<br>
