<h3>Surface and deep structure</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structural interaction between the two modal sets may be seen, if only analogly, in terms of the correlation that was first raised in linguistics between surface and deep structure. We may say that surface structure corresponds to the <i><b>electronic</b></i> dimension, and deep structure to the <i><b>properly digital</b></i> dimension of the website structure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface structure is the one we access in a normal reading mode: we follow in a unilinear frame of mind an argument that is displayed in a way that is structurally the same as on the printed page; similarly, we search for information that is tied to the unilinear reading, much as we would a footnote in a printed text. We may say that the surface structure is <i><b>electronic</b></i> in nature rather than digital: the data are accessed on the computer, but not in terms of their inner digital qualities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i><b>properly digital</b></i> configuration of the website corresponds to the deep structure level. It goes beyond an electronic rendering because of the dynamic interlacing of the various elements. We make use of this digital modality when we work with a digital data base, which builds on an active relationality among cells that does not exist in a printed spreadsheet. A digitally structured website raises this feature to the level of the narrative, as is explained in more detail on a <a href="narrative.htm">separate page</a>.<br>

<h3>"Writing" a digital discourse</h3></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One does not typically approach the task of <i><b>constructing a website</b></i> the way one goes about writing a book or an article. Precisely because the intrinsic structure of a digital discourse is that of an open, dynamic and multilinear aggregate, it is difficult to conceive of it as a whole. And yet one must strive to maintain an overall coherence that makes full use of the expansive mode of the digital structure, while at the same time maintaining and displaying the cohesion of the parts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="systems.htm#split"><b><i>split epistemological system</i></b></a> that is currently the standard in scholarship, does not achieve this goal. It does create the presuppositions for it, especially with a <a href="systems.htm#data_cat">data base system</a> that rests on a pre-set categorization system. But even in this case the sense of the whole is limited to the frame (the matrix of the data base) and does not extend to the content (the data entered in the cells).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does <i><b>web design</b></i> address the issue of digital discourse. It is essentially geared (a) to aesthetics, aiming to make the display  attractive and effective in calling attention to the main point(s) of the intended message, and it is geared (b) to functionality, aiming to direct the attention of the users to what specific information they may be looking for.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing a digital discourse entails, instead, a concern for an integration of the two modalities, in such a way that <i><b>the analog and digital dimensions may be equally interlaced</b></i> as part of a single compositional whole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>A website is the standard embodiment of a digital discourse</b></i>, and the websites in this cluster are meant to serve as an example of how this can happen. A <a href="d-frame.htm">separate section</a> in this hub website deals with the mechanics of how this is implemented.<br>

<h3>"Reading" a digital discourse</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Terminology</b></i> is indicative of an  underlying situation that affects us all deeply. We do not typically speak of reading a website, or studying it. Instead of "readers" we speak of "users" who "surf" on the crest of a moving wave, or "browse" as does an animal nibbling at twigs. We do not think of depth or of nourishment. Which is instead the aim of "reading" and "studying."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may well ask: when is the last time you have <i><b>leisurely "read" a good website</b></i>, and have enjoyed it the way you have enjoyed books that have left a deep trace in your mindset, and even helped shape your character?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundmental reason is that websites are <i><b>not written qua digital discourses</b></i>. Reading is consonant with writing, and as long as we do not properly "write" a website, but only "construct" it (another indicative term) as an aggregate of pieces, we will not have "readers." A reader will look for the whole behind the aggregate, will seek for the impact to be derived from an engaged composition. It is a challenge, one that brings us back to a renewewd appreciation of what <a href="humanities.htm">humanism</a> ultimately means.<br>

<h3>Perspectives</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the first aim (a comprehensive bibliographical support<!--  for <a href="../4banks-index.htm">six aspects</a> of cultural history as they relate to ancient Mesopotamia. , one will find in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> a discursive approach to these topics, and in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small> a set of data in a form that is consonant with a standard annotated bibliography.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding to the second, methodological, aim, I intend to show how a browser based approach, as available in a website, provides a good tool for combining a data set with an argument based narrative. This is achieved by interlacing the sequential texts as given in section I. T<small>HE</small> A<small>RGUMENT</small> with the data found in section II. T<small>HE</small> R<small>ECORD</small>, and viceversa.<br>
