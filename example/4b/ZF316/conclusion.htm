<h3>"Out of the norm"</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is <i><b>out of the norm</b></i> to even imagine that a website may have a <a href="synergy.htm#closure">conclusion</a>, partly because it typically remains constantly in flux, but more importantly because it is not generally conceived and constructed as a <a href="discourse.htm#concept">compositional whole</a>. Precisely because I make instead a case for the need to <a href="discourse.htm#writing">write a website</a> with that goal in mind, I wish to enter here a reflection, in hindsight, about how I think that goal has been achieved in 4banks.net.<br>

<h3>Retrospective</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central goal was to <i><b>explain the nature of the websites</b></i> that are comprised within the cluster <a href="https://www.4banks.net" target=blank>4banks.net</a>. I did not intend to describe the content matter of each website, something that is made sufficiently clear by the title of each. It was rather to show how the very concept of a website is best suited to serve a specific scholarly communication aim.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, I set out to articulate (in Parts 1 and 2) the <i><b>specific digital dimension</b></i> that distinguishes the websites in this cluster from the standard, with particular reference to the notions of digital discourse and digital thought, which are at the core of the whole enterprise. <a href="discourse.htm">Digital discourse</a> is conceived as an entity with an <a href="systems.htm">epistemological status</a> of its own, one that combines data and argument in an integrated whole, with a special <a href="synergy.htm">synergy</a> between the analog and the digital sides of the equation. <a href="thought.htm">Digital thought</a>, on the other hand, refers to the way in which digitality adds a new dimension to the human ability to relate to reality, in ways that are in contrast with the goals of artificial intelligence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established this as my main goal, I then showed <i><b>how the websites in the cluster revolve around this central premise</b></i>, in terms of the two main aims, substantive (Part 3) and methodological (Part 4).<br>

<h3>"In a personal vein"</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote this <a href="overview.htm">hub website</a> in a personal vein, very much in the first person, particularly in my review of the <a href="history-p.htm">long history</a> of the project, and in the even more <a href="humanities.htm#personal">personal reflections</a> about my career and conceptual development in this regard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the reflections about <a href="synergy.htm">synergy</a>, this introductory website can very much be <i><b>accessed concurrently in its bimodal dimension</b></i>. It can be "read" from cover to cover while at the same time it can be "browsed" segmentally. The latter "use" (browsing) is the one we have become accustomed to when "visiting" a website. "Reading" it, instead, entails studying it in its wholeness, internalizing the core argument as presented in its formal multiplicity, drawing as it does on multiple expressive layers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hub website is <i><b>very simple in terms of formal multiplicity</b></i>, because it is relatively short in size, minimal in its recourse to multiple arguments, and without any dependence on databases. But I did contruct ("write") it with a clear intent to achieve a full interplay of the two dimensions, analog and digital. I trust it can lend itself well to experimenting what I consider a <a href="systems.htm#integration">new epistemological system</a>.<br>
