T 9. Indices
D July 2020




Several indices are produced by a [program](../data/DABI.htm) specifically designed and written for our project.<br>

<!--Each new [version](archives.htm) of the website will obviously have an updated set of indices.-->

<br>

In this section one will find three indices. The first is an extensive [topical index](ind-topical.htm), that links individual topics to all the sections of the program.

The other two indices relate to the bibliography. The first lists the entries in [chronological order](bibl_chron.htm), while the second gives a list by individual [author](bibl_short.htm).

<!--The indices pertaining to entries produced by contributors to the website are given in section [10. Authorship](sub-authorship.htm), under each contributor's name in the left side bar.-->

<br>

There is at this point no special search option for the entire website.
