<h1><!-- A companion site to the four volumes<br> -->
<i>Mesopotamia<br>
The Land of the Four River Banks</i></h1>


<i>The phrase "<b>Four River Banks</b>" was introduced around 2200 B.C. by Naram-Sin, king of Akakd, to refer to what we call Meospotamia. The latter is a Greek term and concept ("land between the rivers") which was alien to the ancients who lived there. "Four river banks" refers to the two banls of the Tigris and the Euphrates respectively, the "bank" being the starting point of the irrigation system which charactierized the territory from the middle course of the rives down to the Gulf. It was introduced by Naram-Sin to refer to the new political reality which his gandfather, Sargon, had started to implement and he had consolidated.<br>
<br>
<b>4banks.net</b> is a cluster of four websites dedicated to four coplementary aspects of Mesopotamian civilization: history, literature, art and religion. Each fo these websites is linked to a printed book relating to the correpsnding topic. The four websites are identical in strucutre: they contain an extensive bibliographical coverage and develop themes relating to content and method. They are liked to the printed volumes in the organization of the material, but they serve at the sane time as an independent bibliographical and topical repository.
