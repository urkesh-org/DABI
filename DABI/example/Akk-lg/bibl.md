T Annotated bibliography

HTML bibl



Entries are annotated and linked to specific notes or other places in the website where the work pertains. The links in the upper right of each entry refer to these notes or places. Where an annotation is missing, or replaced by a publisher's summary, the entry serves as a place holder for future annotation.

The annotations are not meant to give a full summary of any given title, but primarily to bring out the relevance of the work with regard to the topics covered in the core section of this website. Square brackets are used to earmark some notes that express the reviewer's opinion.

<!-- For more extended entries on certain items reference is given to the following sections: <a href="../sub-excerpts.htm" target="B">E. (Excerpts and Summaries)</a>, <a href="../sub-synopses.htm" target="gB_home">R. (Reviews and Synopses)</a>, <a href="../sub-themes.htm" target="B">Th. (Thematic excursuses)</a> and <a href="../sub-monographs.htm" target="B">M. (Monographs)</a>.<br> -->

All bibliographical entries are contained in this single file, which is sorted alphabetically by the name of the author(s). Please refer to the left side bar as a jump-off point for the retrieval of given items.

A separate file lists the entries [chronologically](bibl_chron.htm).

Another separate file lists the entries in an [alphabetical](bibl_short.htm) order, with only the name of the author and a short mention of the title.
