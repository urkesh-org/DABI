<h1>Notes to the printed volume</h1>
</center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes are supplementary to the printed volume (<em>"When on High..."</em>). They link to chapter and section of the book, as listed in the left side bar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving the function of footnotes in a printed text, the Notes expand briefly on single points of interest, provide documentation, and give bibliographical references. They are explicitly linked to specific items found in the annotated <A href="sub-bibl.htm" target="B">Bibliography</A> and in other sections of the website. In turn, many bibliographical entries are linked to the Notes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the lower left sidebar (in the <i>Notes</i> sub-section), one will find a detailed Table of Contents of the printed volume that reaches to the lowest sub-level within each chapter. (The <a href="../h/intro-book-ToC.htm" target="book">printed version</a> of the Table of Contents includes only the first three levels.) This detailed Table of Contents will help in placing the content of the website notes in their broader context, even though the fact remains that these website notes are essentially linked to the printed volume, so that reference to it is indispensable for a full utilization of the notes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of each note is identified explicitly by name. Where a name is missing, the note is attributable to the <a href="../authorship.htm">main editor</a>.<br>
