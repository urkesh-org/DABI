<h4 class="h4-notes" id="8.3">8.3 The Social Context</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="8.3">        <li><p>For a discussion of the role of cultural tradition and social context in ancient religions, see <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Brelich1976Prolegomeni">Brelich 1976</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/DePietri.htm">Marco De Pietri</a>, June 2020</p>]</ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="8.4">8.4 The Divine Element as Guarantor or Founding Principle</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="8.4">        <li><p>The polytheistic view of the gods as executors of a law or morality that originated &ldquo;above&rdquo; them also serves to resolve the problem of theodicy. See the treatment of Mastema and the critical comments here: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hamidovic2015Mastema">Hamidovic 2015 Mastema</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>For a reading of YHWH&rsquo;s actions that looks similar to Buccellati&rsquo;s interpretation of polytheism, in that YHWH follows an immutable law that is in a sense &ldquo;above&rdquo; himself, see: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Mathys2015">Mathys 2015</a>. In this reading, YHWH&rsquo;s mercy lies in delayed retribution.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>The Hymn to Shamash, partially translated and published in appendix 3 to &ldquo;When on High&hellip;&rdquo;, describes the god as a judge who applies a pre-existing law. Note for instance verse 98: &ldquo;you impose a punishment on him who perverts justice to pocket a bribe.&rdquo; </p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>Buccellati compares this situation to that of Hammurabi, who is a judge more than a legislator. According to Charpin, on the other hand, the god does not obey a higher law that has ontological coherence. Rather, the god punishes because he is angry. See: (<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Charpin2015Defaite">Charpin 2015</a>). </p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, March 2020</p>]        <li><p>Mendenhall states that “To summarize the biblical concept of social control systems, any action induced by such systems that is based upon individual motivations of economic gain, prestige (publicity), or ambition for power has nothing to do with the Kingdom of God. … The problem in ancient as well as modern times is that most of humanity cannot conceive of the existence of any legitimate and functional motivation for behavior other than money, publicity, and power.” (p. 170). Mendenhall applies his distinction not only to <strong>political structures</strong> but also to <strong>ecclesiastical structures</strong>, which are power structures and suffer from the same social control (and therefore un-biblical) errors that are found in political or corporate structures. “A <strong>community</strong>, on the other hand, is a complex of persons who have something in common other than a power structure, and a value system in which economic well-being is not in the control of a centralized power structure” (p. 173) and has no goal except “the realization in the process of daily life of those values that make life Good.” (p. 174)</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, April 2020</p>]</ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="8.5">8.5 Infringement of the Order</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="8.5">        <li><p>In the biblical perspective, divine wrath is the consequence of an opposition between two wills. For Gonzalez, it also has a pedagogical meaning: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Gonzalez2015Colere">Gonzalez 2015 Colere</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>Mastema plays the role of the tempter, which preserves YHWH&rsquo;s transcendence while explaining a way that human and divine wills could find themselves in opposition. See: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Hamidovic2015Mastema">Hamidovic 2015 Mastema</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>Buccellati affirms that willing is not a specific attribute of the divine element in Mesopotamia. Marti partially challenges and partially confirms this view in his treatment of divine wrath. The god wills, if he exists; but it would seem that instead the god is a stand-in explanation for events that occur on an intra-mundane level. Thus there is no coherence in the god&rsquo;s action. See: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Marti2015">Marti 2015</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]</ol>

<h4 class="h4-notes" id="8.6">8.6 Demons - Curses and Blessings</h4>    
    <ol type="a" class="notes" id="8.6">        <li><p>In the interest of maintaining strict monotheism, the Bible delimits the presence of spiritual beings other than YHWH. However, there are many different spiritual beings even in the Bible, and their character is not greatly dissimilar to the Mesopotamian demonology. By downplaying the structural radicality of monotheism, and simultaneously leaving the concept of demons somewhat ambiguous, Smith&rsquo;s thesis is weakened. See: <a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Smith2001">Smith 2001</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [March 2020</p>]        <li><p>Lambert’s treatment of <strong>angels</strong>/<strong>demons</strong>, which do admit of <strong>monotheism</strong> in the Christian understanding of the term, is at odds with <a href="<a href="/Mes-rel/bibl.htm#Smith2001">Smith 2001</a>">Smith 2001</a>.</p><p class="na"> – [<a href="../../authorship/Lynch.htm">Jonah Lynch</a>, March 2020</p>]</ol>
