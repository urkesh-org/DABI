A study of consonantal incompatibilities in
the structure of verbal roots, with special
emphasis on Arabic. The main conclusions
are that homorganic (including identical)
consonants are excluded from positions I and
II of the same root, homorganic (but not
identical) consonants are excluded from
positions II and III, homorganic (including
.identical) consonants are not frequent in
positions I and III. For his purposes, the
author establishes four sections of homorganic
consonants: back consonants (laryngals,
pharingals, valars), liquids, front consonants
(dentals and sibilants), labials.
