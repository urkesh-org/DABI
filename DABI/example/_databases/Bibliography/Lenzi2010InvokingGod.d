This article examines relationships between **Hebrew laments of the individual** and **Akkadian suilla-prayers** with an emphasis on their respective **invocations** and **hymnic prologues**. In doing so, Lenzi seeks to disprove the historical basis of comparison dominating the field of religious studies in the Near East, arguing in favor of a more nuanced anthropological methodology. He observes a distinction in length of invocations, noting that  the Hebrew Psalter's laments of the individual are notably shorter than the Akkadian suilla-prayers. This is attributed to the "hymnic" quality of the Akkadian texts. Lenzi outlines the various positions of notable scholars with respect to their interpretation of the function of the hymnic prologue and the shorter Hebrew invocation, noting a history of "theological generalizations that imply the superiority of Israelite prayer". Ultimately, Lenzi offers new theoretical approaches that stress an examination of the sociocultural context and shifts attention, as given in ritual studies, on **social proximity** and **formalization**.

TO prayer; invocation; theology

Buccellati stresses the personal distinction of **biblical monotheism** with respect to the experience of the **absolute**. Prayer, in the Mesopotamian sense, as illustrated in the **SÌŒurpu collection**, is of a standardized nature and serves an apotropaic function (to ward off evil) demonstrating that it is devoid of personal nuance.
