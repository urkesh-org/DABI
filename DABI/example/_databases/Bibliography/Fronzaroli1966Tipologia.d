An attempt to locate Semitic languages within the framework of a universal typological perspective; special reference is made to Old Babylonian. The starting point is an article by J. H. Greenberg, in which agglutination is defined as mechanic construction of morphemes (rather than as inalterability of the root); agglutination and its counterpart, fusion, may exist in the same language, and the proportion of their occurrence in a language is understood as the index of agglutination. On the basis of his examination of a sample text of 100 words from the Code of Hammurapi, Fronzaroli gives as index for 08 0.01, one of the lowest on the scale (next to Eskimo; the index for English is 0.30): this means that 08 is fusional to a high degree. With respect to derivation and inflection, the situation is different: 'for the same 08-sample, the index of derivation is 0.59; of inflection 1.40; of prefixation 0.24; of suffixation 0.98; of infixation 0.70. In the last section the author analyzes the notion of "word" in Semitic languages, expecially in such difficult cases as the construct state.
