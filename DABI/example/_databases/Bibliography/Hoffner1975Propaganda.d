TO Decennial Annals of Mursili; Telepinu Proclamation; Apology of Hattusili III; witchcraft; order

Hoffner’s study discusses a few examples of Hittite documents that seek to justify a king who assumed the kingship by force. Part of this justification regards the relation with the gods. In the **Decennial Annals of Mursili**, the king complains that surrounding lords have taunted him. He therefore prayed to the sun goddess of Arinna, who heard his prayer and helped him subjugate the surrounding lands. 

There are two clear examples of <<apologies>>: the **Telepinu Proclamation** and the **Apology of Hattusili III**. 

In the Telepinu Proclamation, there are no divine workings on the king’s behalf. It is a largely unreligious document. At most, it indicates that the gods will revenge the murders of the kings and gives words of reproof spoken through the <<men of the gods>> (p. 53).
In the Apology of Hattusili, reasons for usurping the throne are more religious. First of all, the previous king Urhitesub is portrayed as incompetent and as an <<evil man who has recourse to witchcraft (*alwanzatar*) and other means which displease the gods.>> (p. 54). More fundamentally, his claim to kingship rests upon the will of the gods who have chosen him. The providence of Ishtar brings about victory. 

Hoffner also provides fragmentary evidence for a possible precursor to Telepinu’s apology, in the form of a piece of political propaganda.

TO magic; witchcraft

While **magic** was a normal and licit part of Mesopotamian religious practice, “witchcraft” was not, and was punishable by death. The difference between the two lies in the former serving the restoration of order, and the latter serves the intentional overturning of order.
