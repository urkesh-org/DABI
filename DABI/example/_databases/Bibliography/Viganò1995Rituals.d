TO Ebla; rituals

<<Since 1988, several articles have been published focusing on rituals performed in the ancient city of [**Ebla**](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html). … All these works, directly or indirectly, deal with religious ceremonies. Thus, the question arises concerning which kinds of festivals are recorded in the administrative texts … . … This paper has the very restricted goal of studying a number of those rituals registered in the administrative records>> (p. 215).

The author presents in this paper some ritual texts from the [Archives of the Royal Palace G at Ebla]( http://www.ebla.it/escavi__il_palazzo_reale_g.html): the *Purification Ritual L. 2679*, *Rituals of Regular Offerings* (dug<sub>4</sub>-ga *i-sa-rí / i-sa-i*), and the so-called ‘a:tu<sub>5</sub> ritual’. The first ritual presents four key-elements, already investigated in {B}R/Bonechi1989Ebla:

1) the presence of a ‘purification priest’ [*contra* Viganò, interpreting this term as referring not to the priest but to the ritual itself], called A:NAGA = a:tu<sub>5</sub>;

2) the offering to the god <sup>d</sup>KU-*ra*;

3) its association with dug<sub>4</sub>-ga *i-sa-rí*, probably offerings of garments and wool;

4) the spelling of *da-mi-mu*.
      
The *Regular Offerings*-ritual is then discussed, starting with the different spelling of the term (cf. entry: {B}R/Bonechi1989Ebla): ‘KA.DI-2 = sá.dug<sub>4</sub>-2’, ‘KA-GÁ-2’, and ‘dug<sub>4</sub>-ga’, always appearing with the same gloss ‘*i-sa-rí / i-sa-i*’, i.e. ‘regular’. From the first of these terms, ‘KA.DI-2 = sá.dug<sub>4</sub>-2’, it derived the regular form ‘sá.dug<sub>4</sub>-ga’ (attested on L. 2712), glossed ‘*zi-gi-nu*’ in other texts and interpreted by Milano ([*ARET* 9](https://www.arborsapientiae.com/libro/1710/testi-amministrativi-assegnazioni-di-prodotti-alimentari-archivio-l-2712-parte-1-archivi-reali-di-ebla-testi-ix--lucio-milano.html), p. 402) as deriving from the Semitic *škn*, ‘to provide’ (*et al.*).

[The author discusses in this paper the actual realisation of religious practices at [Ebla](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html), analysing the textual sources with a strict philological approach. This is a clear exemplification of how ancient religious practices can be reconstructed on the base of ancient texts. On the same topic, cf. {B}R/Viganò2000Rituals. A wider discussion on cultic rituals at Ebla can be found in the ‘Theme’ [*Cultic Rituals at Ebla*](http://4Banks.net/Mes-rel/TEMI/Rituals_Ebla_mDP.htm).]

TO Ebla; cultic activities

A description of cultic activities at [Ebla](http://www.ebla.it/eindex.html), an example of Mesopotamian rituality, is offered in {B}R/Viganò1995Rituals (cf. {B}Mes-rel/Viganò2000Rituals and {B}R/Bonechi1989Ebla).
