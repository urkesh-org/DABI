The book of Jubilees, written in the middle of the second century BCE, gives pride of place to demons in the rewritten passages of Genesis and Exodus. During a long time in scholarship, Mastema was known as another name of the demon Satan because of a common etymology. A close examination of both occurrences in the book of Jubilees invites us to **reconsider the relationship between Mastema and Satan in the direction of two separate demons** with different functions in the narrative. Thus, Mastema stands out as an agent of YHWH which oversees the demons in their deeds against nations and Israel. Mastema accomplished another mission by taking the place of God in the passages deemed incompatible with divine goodness. Finally, Mastema endorses the ignominious deeds of God in history in order to explain that God Almighty be angry and punish his people. Consequently, the divine repentance is not necessary. [Author's summary] 

[Hamidović notices that Mastema's meaning as a name, a title and a role are blurry. He points out the attempt to resolve the problem of **theodicy** by ascribing violent actions to Mastema, who obeys the commands of YHWH. This solution to the problem of evil in the book of Jubilees, late in the formation of the Hebrew canon and on the outer boundaries of Jewish orthodoxy, seems to recover some of the features of polytheism: YHWH is absolved of all ambiguity, which is to say that his actions are predictable and orderly. Mastema represents a part of YHWH's behavior that is apparently incoherent with his goodness. A further consequence of this doubling of the divine principle is that YHWH no longer need "repent" of his actions. In this, too, **Mastema seems to represent a return to polytheism**, in which divine actions were distributed among multiple figures, eliminating the pressing need for divine repentance.]

TO theodicy

The polytheistic view of the gods as executors of a law or morality that originated "above" them also serves to resolve the problem of theodicy. See the treatment of Mastema and the critical comments here: {B}R/Hamidovic2015Mastema.

TO theodicy

Mastema plays the role of the tempter, which preserves YHWH's transcendence while explaining a way that human and divine wills could find themselves in opposition. See: {B}R/Hamidovic2015Mastema.
