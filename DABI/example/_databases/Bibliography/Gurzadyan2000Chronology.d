TO chronology; “Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa”

<<This illustrated article represents a popular account of the study of the Babylonian astronomical records of Enuma Anu Enlil tablet series i.e. of the **Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa** and of two lunar eclipses linked with the IIIrd dynasty of Ur, having resulted in the proposal of Ultra-Low chronology of the Near East in II millennium B.C. The emerged Ultra-Low chronology is by 96 years shorter than the conventional Middle chronology and by now is supported by various independent studies. Tables of relative chronologies of principal kingdoms of Mesopotamia are given, along with some dates associated with the fall of Babylon in II millennium B.C. The technical details are given in the book by H. Gasche, J.A. Armstrong, S.W. Cole and V.G. Gurzadyan, “Dating the Fall of Babylon” (Mesopotamian History and Environment, Series II, University of Ghent and Chicago Press, 1998) and in subsequent articles>> (author’s abstract on [Cornell University website](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311114)).

[This paper reviews the topic of the definition of an absolute chronology for Mesopotamian history, mostly basing on the **“Venus Tablet of [Ammisaduqa](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#588)”**, a topic discussed by G. Buccellati in his volume; cfr. also {B}R/Gurzadyan2000Astronomical; {B}R/Gurzadyan2003Venus; {B}R/Gurzadyan2005Chronology.]
