The present *iq&aacute;tal* is the oldest Semitic verbal form, not a later
derivative from the preterite, and it is preserved only in Akkadian
and Ethippic (the documentation is exclusively taken from Ethiopic).
The perfect of the other Semitic languages is derived from the Akkadian permansive, because the latter is more flexible in formation and
vocalization than the former.
