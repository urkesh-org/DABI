This miscellanea collects 9 contributions all related to the topic of the **death or disappearing of a god** in ancient Mediterranean cultures.

After a *preface* by [Paolo Xella](https://pisa.academia.edu/PaoloXella) presenting the topic of the volume, *chapter 1* (by many authors) outlines the topic of the [**dying god**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_or_departure_of_the_gods). 

*Chapter 2* (by Gabriella Scandone Matthiae) describes the figure of ‘Osiris the African’, implying the royal death. 

*Chapter 3* (by [Paola Pisi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paola-pisi-3528288/?originalSubdomain=it)) focuses on the divine figure of [**Dumuzi-Tammuz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumuzid). 

*Chapter 4* (by [Anna Maria Polvani](https://www.anatolistica.unifi.it/vp-167-anna-maria-polvani.html)) deals with the god [**Telipinu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telipinu_(mythology)) and other **hidden gods** in Anatolia. 

*Chapter 5* (by [Paolo Xella](https://pisa.academia.edu/PaoloXella)) relates with [**Baal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal) of [**Ugarit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit) and other **Phoenician gods**. 

*Chapter 6* (by [Sergio Ribichini](http://www.icvbc.cnr.it/Ribichini.pdf)) presents the topic of the disappearance of [**Adonis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis). 

*Chapter 7* (by [Maria Grazia Lancellotti](https://www.liceo-orazio.edu.it/public/Il_Liceo/Organizzazione/CV_Preside.pdf)) aims at outlining the figure of [**Attis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attis). 

*Chapter 8* (by [Giulia Sfameni Gasparro](https://unime.academia.edu/GiuliaGasparro)) displays the story of [**Demeter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter) and [**Kore-Persephone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone) at [**Eleusis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis), linking divine absence to **human fate**. 

*Chapter 9* (by Maria Rocchi) deals with the death of [**Dionysus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus), describing the ‘new harmony of his limbs’. 

An *afterword* (by Ileana Chirassi Colombo) addresses a question (**<<Why a God Must Die>>**) and tries to define the religious significance and the cultural meaning of the figure of the [‘dying god’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_or_departure_of_the_gods).       

[Death is indeed an evident and ineluctable feature of human life; nevertheless, and even unexpectedly, in many religions of ancient Mediterranean world also gods could die, either because of a physical or a ‘symbolic’ death embedded in the disappearing of the god from the human world or even in the common topic of the divinity leaving his/her specific ‘residential’ city. Since the disappearing of a god, sometimes provoking famine or drought, was perceived in antiquity as a punishment caused by human sins, the analysis of such a phenomenon helps in clarifying how ancient men explained natural events as a consequence of a human mistake or offense towards a specific god.]

TO dying gods

As stressed by G. Buccellati in this section, <<gods are liable to death>>: on this topic, see {B}Mes-rel/Xella2001Quando, dealing with ‘death’ or ‘disappearing’ of a god, sometimes provoking famine or drought. The ‘death’ or ‘disappearing’ of a god is unbelievable and unconceivable within a monotheistic thought (believing in God as an eternal entity) while in ancient polytheist systems many examples of [‘dying gods’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_or_departure_of_the_gods) can be detected (e.g. [Ištaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C5%A1taran) equated to [Dumuzid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumuzid (cf. also ; cf. on this topic {B}Mes-rel/Buccellati1982Descent, dealing with the epic poem *Inanna’s Descent into the Underworld*, for which see [ETCSL 1.4.1](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htm)).

TO sin; guilt

On ‘sin’ and ‘guilt’, the ‘death’ or the ‘disappearing’ of a god, sometimes provoking famine or drought, was perceived in antiquity as a punishment caused by human sins: the analysis of such a phenomenon helps in clarifying how ancient men explained natural events as a consequence of a human mistake or offense towards a specific god (see entry: {B}Mes-rel/Xella2001Quando).

TO dying gods

G. Buccellati tells about the ‘disappearance’ or ‘death’ of gods in ancient Mesopotamian religious literature (see section 5.1, point 6): on this topic, see {B}Mes-rel/Xella2001Quando, dealing with ‘death’ or ‘disappearing’ of a god, sometimes provoking famine or drought. The ‘death’ or ‘disappearing’ of a god is unbelievable and unconceivable within a monotheistic thought (believing in God as an eternal entity) while in ancient polytheist systems many examples of [‘dying gods’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_or_departure_of_the_gods) can be detected (e.g. [Ištaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C5%A1taran) equated to [Dumuzid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumuzid (cf. also ; cf. on this topic {B}Mes-rel/Buccellati1982Descent, dealing with the epic poem *Inanna’s Descent into the Underworld*, for which see [ETCSL 1.4.1](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htm)).
