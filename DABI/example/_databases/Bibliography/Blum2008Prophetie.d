TO Israel, prophecy

<<This contribution discusses new hypotheses that attempt to explain the **pre-exilic prophets’ of doom Utterances over Israel/Judah** as literary fiction *ex eventu*. These approaches are based on external evidence of prophetic oracles which are known from royal archives in Mesopotamia, and whose content is different from the biblical texts with regard to addressing and form of transmission. An extrapolation of this evidence to ancient Near Eastern prophecy in general, would, however, be short-sighted -- as is indicated by methodological considerations, as well as the Bileam text of *Tell Dēr ‘Allā*. A more precise interpretation already proves the latter as a kind of tradition literature (*Traditionsliteratur*) which reflects the concept of a prophecy of doom (not directed towards the king). In contrast to the discussed views this contribution argues that while, on the one hand, the assumption of a radical prophecy of doom in Judah after 587 B.C.E. lacks any evidence and inner plausibility there were, on the other hand, fundamental conceptual prerequisites for prophecies of doom (such as those of Amos or Isaiah) already present in the ancient Near East […]>> (from author’s abstract on p. 81).

[The contribution is very helpful in re-defining the concept of prophecies *ex eventu* in ancient Israel, between reality and literary fiction, and offers a comparative approach with Mesopotamian prophecies.]
