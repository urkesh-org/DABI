While in phonology Nuzu Akk. is close to Middle Babylonian, in other respects it shows substantial differences, e.g.: the treatment of sibilants in the writing system (dependance from Old Akk.); in morphology, the use of *-me* to form the indefinite relative (*mannu-me* "whoever"), lack of feminine forms of the verb, suffix *-u* for the ist plural of the verb (*nilq&#363;-ma*); in syntax, peculiar rules of governement (direct object in the nominative when before the subject; verb in the plural when direct object is in the plural), and use of *-ma* for emphasis only. The conclusion is that Nuzu Akk. is a third dialect next to Assyrian and Babylonian.
