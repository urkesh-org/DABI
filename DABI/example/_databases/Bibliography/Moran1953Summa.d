The article states Moran's disagreement with Knudtzon's translation of *&#353;umma* as "for", in clauses where no apodosis follows and in which the translation would normally be "if". On the basis of comparisons with similar constructions in Hebrew, So. Arabic, and Ugaritic, it seems better to render the meaning with the translation "Lo", or "Behold". Moran adds several more examples to Knudtzons's list. In one instance EA 244 30-43, the passage translates: "Behold! The city is destroyed by pestilence (and) by... So may the king give a hundred men as garrison to guard his city, lest Labaya seize it. Lo! Labaya etc." Here, Knudtzon's translation has been altered. He had joined the first *&#353;umma* clause to the proceeding clause making this position of the protasis very rare. Moreover- there is, as the sense of the sentence points out, no need to ask for troops if the city is destroyed. Moran concludes that the use of *&#353;umma* in this sense is an Accadian trait rather than Canaanite, as in it such constructions are rare, but he does not rule out the possibility of Canaanite influence altogether.
