“Then the king had to crouch down and, in a formal prayer, assure Bel, the god of the city, that he had not committed any sin during the year, that he had not been negligent toward the sacred city and its sanctuary, and, further, that he had not offended a person enjoying the status of kidinnu by slapping his face. This startling statement, appearing in a royal confession of political capital sins, shows us the **importance attributed to human dignity** unusual in the ancient Near East and, for that matter, in other early civilizations in the west. The citizens of Babylon and other Mesopotamian cities appear thus to have become a class set apart from and above the rest of the population not for ethnical or economic reasons but solely because they were natives of certain cities.” Excerpt From: A. Leo Oppenheim. “Ancient Mesopotamia: Portrait of a Dead Civilization.” Chapter 2, section The City.
