The short section which describes the grammatical characteristics of the names for parts of the body (pp. XV-XCIIl) notes that the primary names do not exhibit prefixed patterns, but show a preference for afformative *-an-*, for long third radical and for reduplicated base. In terms of external inflection, it is noted that many names are feminine singular, and, if occurring in pairs, feminine dual (suggesting thus in general a relationship between feminine singular, or nomen unitatis, and the dual).
