Taking position against JACOBSEN ("Ittallak ni&#257;ti") the author reinterprets various example of accusative as accusative of relation rather than ablative accusative. The examples occur with six verbs of motion (*atlukum*, *hal&#257;qum*, *m&#257;tum*, *maq&#257;tum*, *nah&#231;ubum*, *nagmurum*) and five other verbs (*masum*, *mi&#257;dum*, *bu&#257;rum*, *en&#363;*, *ti&#257;bum*) e.g.*(&#353;a) ihhasbanni* "(a measuring rod) was cut off for me." Criticism is also expressed of Jacobsen's interpretation of the ventive (*nim* occurs exceptionally with singular verb)and of the ending *-i* (which would have no more than a strongly emphasizing function).
