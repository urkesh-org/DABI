Reviews the supposed exceptions to the law stated by BARTH and concludes that they are not real exceptions. The most important clarifications to Barth's rule are that *m* does not change to *n* if the vowel immediately following is *u* (196 f.), and that loanwords, e.g. *melammu*, are not subject to the rule (198). Certain forms with prefix *na-* and no labial in the root (e.g. *nannaru*, *na&#351;&#351;aru*) are due to the influence of dentals (201). The nouns *ikkibu*, *ikribu*, *immiru*, *iptiru* and *iptinu* are originally of a pattern *mipris*, changed to *nipris* because of the root labial, and finally to *ipris* for a law similar to that of the verbs primae Nun (202 f.). Other presumed exceptions are explained on a lexical basis, e.g. *mam&#299;tu* comes from a root *mar&#363;* and *mamlu* from a root *&#42;mml* (192-5).
