Forms with or without mimation are used in OB "&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s indiff&eacute;remment" (p. 75), but they preserve traces of an original system which opposed determined to undetermined forms, which may also be paralleled in their opposition by different forms in the plural, according to the following scheme (p. 78):

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>singular</td>
    <td> </td>
    <td>plural</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>gereral (or non determined): </td>
    <td>plain radical [i.e. base]</td>
    <td rowspan=2>(traces only)</td>
    <td rowspan=2>radical + long vowel</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td>radical + vowel</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>individual (or determined): </td>
    <td>radical + vowel + m</td>
    <td> </td>
    <td>radical + &#226;n + (long vowel)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

A possible hypothesis on the origin of miation is that it is derived from enclitic *-me* and that mimation is of secondary formation. When mimation was not operative any more, it is possible that *&#353;&#363;* may have served as definite and *w&#275;d&#363;m* as indefinite article.
