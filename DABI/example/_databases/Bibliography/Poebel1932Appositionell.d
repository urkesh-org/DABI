The sequence of the type PN *an&#257;ku* in royal inscriptions is not a nominal sentence ("*I* am PN") but rather the subject with apposition of
a longer sentence ("*I*, PN, .... "). The bulk of the documentation is
from NW Semitic; for Akkadian, the case is made only marginally on
the basis of stylistic criteria. It is also noted that from a sequence PN *an&#257;ku*, of Sumerian influence, in the earlier texts, one goes
to the sequence *an&#257;ku PN* in texts from the 7th - 6th centuries, most
likely under Aramaic influence.
