Moran states his task as to present evidence using 66 Amarna texts from Byblos which will demonstrate the existence of the West Semitic *yaqtula* verb form in Canaanite. The difficulty in proving the argument is that this form when written, is identical with the Accadian Ventice (-*a* suffix). The use of this form is to express a wish, request, or command; and it is also used in clauses of purpose or intended result. The author has found 36 occurances of *yaqtula* used in the former sense, and 13 in the latter. In West Semitic, if the verb of the first clause in a two clause sentence states a fact and is in the indicative (e.g. *yaqtulu*), then the second or purpose clause will also be indicative. But if the first clause verb is imperative, jussive, or a *yaqtula* form expressing a wish, the purpose clause will use *yaqtula*. This is the rule of model congruence and the author's reason for denying that the ventive -*a* is meant in these cases. Moreover, he gives a lucid example of his point from EA 124 14-15: "yupahhiru-yilqu 'he is gathering- that he may take'" and in EA 17 28-30: "ul yaphhira-yilqa 'let him not gather- that he may take'". Here are two identical verbs, persons, and contexts for which the use of the ventive would offer no explanation in the shift from *-u* to *-a*. As additional evidence, the use of the *yaqtula* verb is pointed out in Biblical Hebrew where it is used in the sense for the cohortative and is goverend by modal congruence. In the remaining samples from Amarna, when *yaqtula* is used in conditional sentence protases or in apodoses, examples from Hebrew and Arabic can be cited as proof of this form's existence.
