"1. A propos of Akkadian *&#303;&#257;'um, &#303;attun and &#303;&#226;'ttun*" (361-66). Analyzes *ia-um* as *y&#257;'um* i.e. with long vowel and aleph, not contracted in OB to *y&#363;m*; the feminine sing. *yattun* is due to quantitative metathesis for *yatun*, while the fern. plur. is *y&#257;tum*. The form *y&#257;'uttun* is a sing. fem, with the afformative *-&#363;t* used to express the feminine instead of *-at*.—
"2. On some Old Babylonian Names in *-&#303;a*, *-tum*, *-&#303;atum* and *&#303;a&#251;tum*" (pp. 366-80). The name of the type Ahiya is not a hypochoristicon, meaning "little brother,"; but a pseudo-vocative with pronominal suffix meaning "my brother." The affirmative *-at* is diminutive, hence *Abatum* "little father,” *Ab&#299;yatum* "my little father"; *-&ugrave;t* may occur as a variant of *-at*.—
"3. The Old Assyrian Independent Possessive Pronouns" (pp. 381-410). On the basis of a detailed documentation, the function of the indep. possessive, predicative and substantival use of the independent pronouns, the "pleonastic" use of indep. plus suffix pro noun is also studied.—
"4. Paronomastic Infinitives in Classic Akkadian" (pp. 410-15). Establishes the equation: accusative = *ana* + genitive = locative in *-&#363;m*. Hence the use of the paron. infinitive in *-&#363;m* is identical to that in *-am*.
