Kitz analyzes curses in the Ancient Near East from a religious and social perspective, with an approach which is similar to the one used by Buccellati in his volume. She highlights how cursing "importuned" patron deities as well as personal deities, to injure others so that the well-being of the person or community who cursed might be sustained.

Kitz highlights the cultural difference between the ancient and modern perceptions of curses: in the Near East, a curse did not necessarily imply an offensive language nor the presence of insults. Rather, curses aimed at soliciting a god (or many gods) to harm a person, place or thing: in Mesopotamia, thus, **"since curses are wishes, they are, therefore, petitionary prayers to the deities. ... To petition a deity to injure another is to seek a blessing for oneself. ... Thus, many curses may be properly viewed as indirect blessings, a fact that may have contributed to their popularity in the Ancient Near East."** (p. 616)

Interestingly, this article offers examples from both the Bible and the Near East, discussing similarities and differences between the two cultural words.
