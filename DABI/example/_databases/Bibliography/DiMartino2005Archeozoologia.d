An overview on **faunal osteological remains** from Tell Mozan/Urkesh ([**Area A12**](http://urkesh.org/pages/89-A12.htm), the [***ābi***](http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm)) is offered in this paper: around 1037 samples have been analysed, belonging to mammals, birds and rodent. 

In general, we can reconstruct that sheep were more consumed than goats and that also wild animals (such as the onager) were present on the site. 

A NMI (‘minimal number of individuals’) ratio was calculated, the results being displayed in tables 2-3, on p. 70. Traces of **butchering** and the presence of some specific bones of the animal could hint to a **deliberate selection** of some anatomical parts for **ritual purposes** (considering the peculiar emplacement of the items). 

Some animals were bred for practical goals (to obtain meat, milk, wool or for working force) or for specific intents (such as the dogs, probably used in **sacrifices**). 

The osteometrical study of the bones can also provide us with information about the age of death and the actual size of the various animals (for specific details, see tables on pp. 77-79).	     

[The contribution is particularly relevant for the identification and functional use of the *ābi*, an underground structure uncovered at Urkesh/Tell Mozan, where necromantic practices connected to ancestor cult where performed. In this contribution, the author analysis the type of animals sacrificed in the necromantic pit, on the base of a precise osteometrical study.]

TO necromancy; *ābi*

This study allows to better understand the ritual practices performed in a structure similar to the Biblical *’ôb* (see [*1 Sam.* 28,7]( https://www.tanakhml.org/d13.php2xml?sfr=8&prq=28&psq=1&lvl=99&pnt=tru&acc=tru&dia=tru&enc=heb&xml=fls)) mentioned by G. Buccellati in the present section. The contribution {B}R/DiMartino2005Archeozoologia offers an osteometrical study of the animals sacrificed at [Urkesh/Tell Mozan](http://urkesh.org/) in the  [*ābi*](http://urkesh.org/pages/037c.htm), giving an archaeological evidence for necromantic practices in ancient Near East.
