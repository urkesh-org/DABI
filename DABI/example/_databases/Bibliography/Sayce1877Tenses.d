A description of the tenses, in all stems, with ample documentation bearing especially on the morphology. The permansive (26-35), related to the WSem. perfect, is considered as evidence of a stage when SemiÓÅètic had only one tense, without temporal differentiation. The present and the aorist (i.e. preterite) are considered as having originally had the three case endings of the noun, of which the ending *-i(m)* was soon dropped for phonological reasons; *-a(m)* is the objective case, used before an accusative, with verbs of motion and in relative and conditional sentences (37), *-u(m)* is the subjective case, used in a pluperfect sense and frequently after a relative or conditional particle; the construct aorist, i.e. without case endings, is due to phonetic decay, while mimation is an energic form. The same scheme obtains for the present (39-44); except that here the subjective case in *-u* stands for the future. The personal markers of number, being the same for verb and noun, prove that aorist and present, like the permansive, were originally nouns (44-48); the prefix vowel was originally added only to patterns with initial consonantal cluster, for euphonic reasons (48-50); similarly, the feminine *t* is the same that is found in the noun, and was probably originally a separated word, on the basis of evidence from Old Egyptian and Berber (50-52). In the conclusions it is emphasized, among the rest, that while "in the Aryan languages the noun presupposes the verb,  ...  in Semitic the verb presupposes the noun" (53).
