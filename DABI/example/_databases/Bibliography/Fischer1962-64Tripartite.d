Differently from common opinion, the origin of the notion of a tripartite division noun, verb and particle is derived from Aristotle's *Poetics*, chapters 20-22. After a well-documented and instructive survey of the material pertaining to the Syro-Arabic transmission of the *Poetics*, the author gives an interesting analysis of the main grammatical terms in Aristotle, and their equivalents used by Arab grammarians.
