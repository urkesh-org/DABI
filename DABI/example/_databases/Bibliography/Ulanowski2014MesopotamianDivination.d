TO divination; future

Ulanowski opens his article with a definition of divination, i.e., <<human observation of signs perceived to be divine and our response to them>> (p. 14). Divination in ancient Mesopotamia was based on the idea that the future was pre-determined - and yet, men could receive some indications on the future by the gods, mostly via omens and portents which could be observed and/or elicited. Thus, the author infers that the future was conceived not solely as a creation of the gods, but as the result of an interaction between men and gods.

The author traces a useful (though brief) history of divination in Mesopotamia, from the Sumerian texts of the third millennium BCE to the first millennium. The author considers divination indeed as a form of ritual (i.e. a formal procedure carried out by trained practitioners in order to provide clients with answers) but also as 'pure performance'. He analyzes the roles played by the several deities involved in the divinatory practices (Shamash, Adad, Sin, Ninsianna and Ea).

Finally, Ulanowski highlights the performatice act inherent in the very act of the interpretation of signs - hence the stress which placed in the ancient written sources with regards to the skill of the professionals and the secrecy in the transmission of texts connected to their professions.
