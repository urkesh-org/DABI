First a complete survey is offered of the usage
of the determinative pronouns as *nota genitivi* (NG)
in all Semitic languages. Three main environments are distinguished: NG occuring between
construct and construent, NG and construent
preceding the construct, no construct. The
introduction of the term "determinative" is
due to Ungnad, and as a result the term has
become entrenched only in the grammar of
Akkadian (and Ugaritic). The term should be
understood in a syntactical rather than semantic
function: the determinatives are nonautonomous pronouns, in that they need to be
foliowed by another element, i. e. either a
complement of specification (then the pronoun
may be more narrowly defined as NG) or a relative
phrase (*nota relationis*). A comprehensive
and meaningful subdivision of all pronouns as
autonomous and non-autonomous is then given by
the author (see especially pp. 70 and 147).
