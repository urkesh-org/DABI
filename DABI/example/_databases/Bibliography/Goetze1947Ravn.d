The particle *&#353;a* is not "generalizing" because it serves to individualize, i.e. to add a more precise and definite specification to the head of the construction. This is apparent especially where *&#353;a* serves for annexion (of which Goetze states the distinctive conditions vs. the use of the construct state) and in the expression of the type *&#353;a nad&#257;nim* which is not indefinite ("something to pay with") but rigorously definite ("the amount necessary for full payment"). Clauses with *&#353;a* without immediate antecedent normally precede all other constituentes in the sentence (*&#353;a kaspam inaddinu &#353;e'am ileqqe*) or else, at least in the Code, the pronoun used is *&#353;u* instead of *&#353;a*. The conclusive definition of *&#353;a* given by Goetze is: "a particle of reference which ascribes a specification to a definite person or a definite thing" (79).
