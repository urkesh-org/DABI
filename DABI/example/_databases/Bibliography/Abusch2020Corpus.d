TO divination; witchcraft


Decades in the making, this massive four volume work brought together by Abusch et. al. is a new edited comprehensive collection of relevant Mesopotamian anti-witchcraft ritual texts (i.e, those which were created to ward off the effects of witchcraft, or black magic).  The authors describe the nature of anti-witchcraft literature (in essence, a subsidiary of divination) in brief, but succinct detail at the outset of the first volume.  They then proceed to organize the massive text corpus in a somewhat ‘non user-friendly’ way. Texts from the same collection of texts (named as Groups) are interspersed throughout the three volumes (the fourth volume is a collection of the glossary and indices).  The interested reader will get the impression as to how normative these texts were; individuals (who had the resources), regularly consulted the religious technicians to determine which ritual text would help them in their romantic, personal, business, or legal dealings.
