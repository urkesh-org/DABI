The first classical formulation of Akkadian grammar, more comprehensive and detailed than 
any of the earlier synthesis, with a broad documentary basis and a serious effort at internal coherence 
and systematization. Truly a masterpiece for its time, it retained a unique value as a reference work for 
over 60 years, until VON SODEN 1952 Grundriss, and is still today worthy of careful reading. Besides 
the traditional tripartite description of the language in phonology (pp. 72-127), morphology (128-322) 
and syntax (323-64), it contains an overview of previous research and a section on writing. The approach 
is of course influenced by the grammar of the other Semitic languages, but comparative considerations 
are kept to a minimum, and the language is mostly seen from within its own system. Only seldon 
does comparativism lead to erroneous results (e.g. the consideration of t- as the regular prefic of 3rd 
sing. fe,. in the indicative, p. 249, 251); otherwise, odd phenomena are recorded as such, without attempts 
at leveling data to make them square with preconceived schemes (e.g. for our ventive, p. 134, 
254, and our perfect, p. 239). The main feature of the book is that, even though intended as an introductory 
manual (see esp. p. 80*), it contains a considerable amount of original discussion of grammatical 
problems, and an impressive array of documentary evidence; see esp. the sections on Sumerian (pp. 
69-71, 195-97), the vowel e (74-79), stress (120-127), primitive nouns (146-50), biconsonantal roots (143- 
57, 313 f.), verb forms of state and action conceived as "Existenzweisen" (234-49), the nature of final 
weak radical (297-302), and root vowel (196 verbs are listed for strong roots and roots I/n, I/', pp. 261- 
65, 273 f., 280 f.). Good documentation is given even for relatively rare forms, such as the &#352;D stem (233 f.) 
and then for every type of root, strong and weak.
