This article provides a thorough analysis and contextualization of the cuneiform tablet K.5268+K.5333a, which is a bilingual hymn to Nergal written not only as a prayer for the benefit of Bel-remanni, but first and foremost as a thanksgiving hymn to Nergal following Bel-remanni’s salvation. In order to provide the proper backround for this source, Gabbay discusses the existence of other thanksgiving hymns in Sumerian and Akkadian literature; he focuses his attention in particular on those compositions that name the individual who has experienced salvation. Gabbay, then, asks what is the significance of naming an individual in a prayer?

The scholar states that, in addition to apotropaic, theological, and liturgical functions, prayers also had another function: they bore witness to (supposedly) actual events that were experienced by actual individuals. «Testimony to an act of salvation by a god substantiates and validates the belief system relating to this god, and consequently strengthens it. (...) These texts declare the
society’s acknowledgement of the power of the god and then ask for the god’s blessing, which explicitly or implicitly indicates that receipt of the blessing will be a further testimony that will validate this widespread belief and further confirm the power of the god in society» (p. 226).
