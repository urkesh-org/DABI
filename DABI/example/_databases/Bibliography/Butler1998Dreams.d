TO Mesopotamian dreams

The volume deeply analyses the structure and the way of interpreting **dreams** in ancient **Mesopotamia**, recurring also to results of scientific research (in psychoanalysis and medicine) on the REM sleep and Simplified Sleep Cycles. The author further discusses the connection between dream interpretation and the conception and role of fate/destiny in human life, a link clearly exemplified by Mesopotamian oneirology.
