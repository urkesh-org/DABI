«Alfred Gell puts forward a new anthropological theory of visual art, seen as a form of instrumental action: the making of things as a means of influencing the thoughts and actions of others. He argues that existing anthropological and aesthetic theories take an overwhelmingly passive point of view, and questions the criteria that accord art status only to a certain class of objects and not to others. The anthropology of art is here reformulated as the anthropology of a category of action: Gell shows how art objects embody complex intentionalities and mediate social agency. He explores the psychology of patterns and perceptions, art and personhood, the control of knowledge, and the interpretation of meaning, drawing upon a diversity of artistic traditions — European, Indian, Polynesian, Melanesian, and Australian.» [Editor’s summary]

[Gell suggests that **commensality must be considered as a tool for recognising the role of non-human entities within the human and social universe: thus, serving food to an inanimate being, such as a statue or an icon, had sense because it prompted a causal sequence, which had an impact on human life**. In his work, Gell does not explicitly mention Mesopotamia but he discusses similar Egyptian religious practices, see pp. 134-135.]
