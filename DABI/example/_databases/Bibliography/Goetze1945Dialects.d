Non-mathematical texts belong to two main OB dialects, Northern (Hammurapi court, Dilbat, Sippar) and Southern (Larsa). Mari seems to belong to a third group, whereas too little is known about Ur and Uruk. Several features distinguish the two dialects are singled out, most of them dealing with orthography: signs with emphatic stops ( /*ta*/ = TA in the North vs. DA in the South), with samekh (SA, AS vs. ZA, AZ), with labial ( /*pi*/ = BI vs. Pi), with *y* ( /*aya*/ = A-IA vs. A-A), marker of contraction or intonation length (used regularly in the North, and extended in the South to cases without contraction or special intonation), phonetic complements (VC vs. CVC). Phonologically, nasalization of long voiced stop begins in the South. Syntactically, addition of the subjective genitive to the infinitives (*tuppi ina am&#257;r&#299;-ka*) is typical of the South. Lexically, a word such as *unnedukk&#363;* is typically Southern. -On the basis of these criteria, Goetze distinguishes the mathematical texts in groups coming from Larsa, Uruk and the North.
