TO forgiveness; revenge

[Author's summary] The Assyrian king, as a representative on Earth of his tutelary deity, Aššur, was logically considered as his "armed wing", and therefore the implement of the divine wrath, wrath which often resulted from the breaking by the vassal or the ally of the pact he had concluded with the king of Assyria. The royal Assyrian inscriptions as an ideological expression of world domination usually illustrate this punishment, but sometimes they mention military campaigns leading to forgiveness. Here we analyse two instances illustrating these two opposite attitudes. First, that of the "impossible forgiveness", illustrated by the campaign of Assarhaddon against the kingdom of Šubria, where the opposing king tried unsuccessfully, by all means, to escape the Assyrian God's wrath. Then, that of the "impossible revenge" against the king of Tyre, Ba'alu, to whom accordingly, for the sake of Real-politik, divine forgiveness was the logical outcome of the military expedition.

TO divine will

Buccellati affirms that willing is not a specific attribute of the divine element in Mesopotamia. Marti partially challenges and partially confirms this view in his treatment of divine wrath. The god wills, if he exists; but it would seem that instead the god is a stand-in explanation for events that occur on an intra-mundane level. Thus there is no coherence in the god's action.
