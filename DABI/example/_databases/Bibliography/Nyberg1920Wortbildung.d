Detailed examples From all main Semitic
languages, including Akkadian, are listed to
show that the prefixes *ma-/mi-*, *&#353;a-/&#353;u-,* *ha-/hi-* and *&#39;a-/&#39;i-* have to be interpreted as
original relative and demonstrative pronouns.
Thus Akkadian *m&#299;&#353;aru*, e. g. is derived from
*&#42;may&#353;ar* meaning "that which is straight" (p, 182).
The same interpretation is applied to the
various causative prefixes, of which ten different meaning categories are distinguished
(pp. 250-261, with examples from four of
them for Akkadian), though all prefixes are
assumed to have a common origin (pp. 261-69).
Such sentences are conceived as reflecting
an early syntactical stage of Proto-Semitic,
For the non prefixed patterns, note especially
the contention (p. 188) that Akkadian *ika&#353;&#353;ad*
is not derived from Proto-Semitic *gatala* (Bauer).
Pp. 273-289 provide useful word indexes.
