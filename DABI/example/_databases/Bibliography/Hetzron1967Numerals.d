Even though it does not deal with Akkadian per se, it is quoted here because it contains (pp. 180-188) an instructive review of theories concerning the gender incongruence between numerals and corresponding head nouns, and a new formulation of the theory of polarity to explain the same phenomenon (pp. 188-93, 196). Polarity of genders is assumed to have been a principle governing the entire system of plural formation of Proto-Semitic (i.e. feminine markers were used in the plurar of nouns which were masculine in the singular); the incongruence of numerals is but a survival of this system: a singular masculine noun became feminine in the plural, and the numeral *agreed* with it by being also in the feminine; at a later stage, the plural of the noun was changed into a masculine, but not so for the numerals which remained in the feminine. "This meant that instead of a positive agreement with the co-occurring plural (the gender of which underwent changes), the original corollary, [i.e.] the co-existent but originally irrelevant negative agreement [=discord] with the unterlying singular noun, became the only workable device‚Äù(p. 196).
