A long passage from a kudurru of Meli-&#352;ipak exhibits 17 verbal forms, *all* of them in the basic stems, in the first section where the king calls on his successors to behave as well as he had done; in the second and third section, on the other hand, containing blessings and curses, there are 32 verbal forms, *all* of them from *t*-stems. The conclusion is that the basic forms are used for possibility, the *t*-forms for actuality.
