Depending on the treatment accorded to sibilants, various dialects are distinguished in OB, all of which can be grouped in two major categories: the first one, at the margins of the OB area (Southern OB, Mari, Susa), retains a hitherto unrecognized proto Semitic sibilant designated as *Sx*, while the second or central group (Northern OB, Upper Mesopotamia) represents an element of change in that *sx* coalesces with PSem. *s*. Similar differentiations may be observed in the treatment of the pronominal suffixes of third person after words containing sibilants or dentals. These conclusions are based on a detailed treatment of the writing peculiarities in the various dialects, summarized in a detailed chart at the beginning. The new consonant *sx* posited by Goetze has not been indicated in my phonemic inventory for, besides being in any case a phenomenon of limited attestation geographically and lexically (only 8 words are affected) the whole problem is in need of more discussion (for 0Akk. see Galb 1961, *MAD* II2, pp. 34-40; 209).

A subdivision into two major categories of sibilants suggests the presence of different dialects in OB. A new consonant is also posited. See {B}Lg/Goetze1958Sibilants.
