TO food prohibitions; abstention 

This article sets out to investigate the essence and purpose of prohibitions concerning meat in first millennium Mesopotamian society. Among the edible substances, meat has been considered throughout human history as a supreme food, the core around which the main meals and feasts can and should be arranged - meat, however, is also the most likely target of vetoes and regulations, when compared with other edible substances. The article at first considers the Sumerian and Akkadian words referring to interdictions and their relevance in the realm of dietary regulation, and then presents the texts dated to the first millennium BCE that provide the most useful information on the relationship between Mesopotamian people and meat, with a particular reference to its ban. Then, it discusses in detail the types of prohibited animals and the particular circumstances in which vetoes were observed. Finally, the consequences of the infringement of dietary proscriptions are discussed, together with the countermeasures taken in order to appease the gods and regain a pure status.

In first-millennium BCE Mesopotamia, dietary rules seem to have been effective almost exclusively in a religious context, and even more so, for special rites or religious performances. The observance of rules, including the dietary ones, was crucial for positive maintenance of the mutual relations between worshippers and deities. Indeed, purity in ancient Assyria was not an absolute concept, but it depended on the time of the year and the specific circumstance. In particular, meat prohibitions were a transitory reality: there were no permanent, unchangeable food regulations which remained valid across the Near East, but rather multiple well-defined, temporary prohibitions which targeted different members of the society in different social contexts.
