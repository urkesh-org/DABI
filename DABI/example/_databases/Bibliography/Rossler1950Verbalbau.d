After asserting the essential similarity of the languages of the Semito-Hamitic family with respect to root structure, stem and tense system, six languages are analyzed individually to bring out the elements most fruitful for comparison. Akkadian is treated on pp. 470-78; the lack of active verbal adjectives of the B stem with second vowel *a* is archaic (and its introduction in later Semitic languages an innovation); similarly archaic is the connecting vowel *a* in *lab&#353;&#257;ta* (p. 473); the "present" serves actually to express repetition, continuation or habit, hence the nominal pattern *parras* which expresses professional habit (477). In the discussion of Berber (478-86) the similarities with Akkadian are emphasized (see esp. p. 486). The study ends with an attempt at historical reconstruction, which places Berber at the oldest stage, and Akkadian in the middle (as the oldest, however, of the Semitic group). The nominal use of the "Suffix-conjugation" (as in Akkadian) is considered older than the verbal use (as with the WSem. perfect).
