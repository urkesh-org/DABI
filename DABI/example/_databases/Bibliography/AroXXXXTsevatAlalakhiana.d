Discussion of Smith *Id-Rimi* and Wiseman *Alalakh*, with long bibliography of reviews and studies. In two sections: I: comments and notes on individual texts, in great detail; II: contributions of Alalakh texts to Canaanite linguistics and Hebrew literary studies. Alalakh differs from EA in that it consists mainly of lists and similar stereotypes texts; there is a Hurrian background; no Canaanite glosses occur; in general, a rather 'adequate' knowledge of Akkadian is evidenced. Tsevat then lists the various Canaanisms occuring in the texts, which are rather few.
