TO Speculative thought

<<This volume intended a journey to the origin of thought and theory through mythopoetic tales and religions of ancient Near East including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Israel. It is a substantial source to reveal the ancient man’s perspectives of the world, gods, and himself. The writers aimed to deal with speculative thought concerning the nature of the universe, the function of the state, and the values of life. They argued that speculation found unlimited possibilities for development in ancient Near East because it was not restricted by a scientific (that is, a disciplined) search for truth. They also noticed that the realm of nature and the realm of man were not distinguished. The experiencing of this unity with the utmost intensity was the greatest good ancient oriental religion could bestow>> (from [OI website](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/intellectual-adventure-ancient-man-essay-speculative-thought-ancient-near#:~:text=Ancient%20Near%20East-,The%20Intellectual%20Adventure%20of%20Ancient%20Man%3A%20An%20Essay%20on%20Speculative,%2C%20H.%20A.%20Frankfort%2C%20John%20A.&text=This%20volume%20intended%20a%20journey,Egypt%2C%20Mesopotamia%2C%20and%20Israel.)).

[This book offers useful insights on speculative thought in ancient Mesopotamia, stressing the existence of a ‘philosophic mind’ before the birth of Greek philosophy as ‘science’. More in detail, section 2 on Mesopotamia (by Th. Jacobsen) focuses on the description of Mesopotamian view on the ‘cosmos’, perceived as a primeval ‘order’ acting in all realms of common life, influencing both the political and personal sphere of interaction with reality. On the same topic, cf. also {B}R/Bottéro1992Reasoning.]
