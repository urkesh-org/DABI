The formation of nouns if often affected phonologically by other nouns which are close in
meaning and phonological shape. This occurs (1) for word pairs, p.10 ff, e.g. Arabic Q£bll - H£bil, instead
of Qayin - Habil; (2) for nominal patterns, p. 14 ff. e.g. Aramaic 'e&#353;taj£m£ from Akkd &#353;atamma
under the influence of gayy£n£, p. 23; (3) for the analysis of toots, p. 24 ff. The latter is the only
category in which Akkadian is explicitly considered (p. 35 f.), and with the general remark that the influence 
of rhyme in word formation is generally scarce in Akkadian. Among the examples given is
mag£ru, which the author connects with Hebr. m£g£n, "to give as a gift," Aram. magg£n, "gratis," explaining
the final r through phonological influence of Akkad mah%£ru. [See already, though without
Akkadian documentation, S. FRAENKEL, "Zum sporadischen Laut Wandel in den semitischen Sprachen," BA 3 (1898) 60-86.]
