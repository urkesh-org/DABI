TO Mesopotamian deities; Storm-god; Baal; Haddu/Adda/Adad/Iškur/Teššub; formal and functional analysis

The author collects in this volume, divided into 7 chapters, many data from ancient cuneiform sources related to **Mesopotamian deities**.

*Chapter 1* describes the modern classification of the various types of **gods**, analysing their formal and functional entity and comparing the ancient and the modern perspective on divinities.
 
*Chapter 2* focuses on the modern systematic classification of Mesopotamian gods according to the ancient **lists of gods**.

Chapter 3 discusses the figure of the Semitic god [**Hadda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad) as he is described in ancient sources and according to his iconographical and statuary depictions, describing his main places of worshipping.

*Chapter 4* displays an analysis of the Sumerian god [**Iškur**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ishkur), deriving from Ur III period’s sources, describing his main worshipping places ([Karkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qarqar), [Girsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girsu), [Umma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umma), [Nippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippur), [Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur), and [Uruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk)), presenting a list of the main rituals performed for him, retracing the composition of his own divine family, and discussing the interpretation of this god as [**Adda**/**Addu**/**Adad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad) (in the Babylonian culture), or as other local gods.

*Chapter 5* deals with the diffusion of the cult of **Addu** in the Upper Mesopotamia, in Babylonia, and in the Susiana, describing his main temples (with an insight on his respective consorts).

*Chapter 6* exposes the later syncretism of [**Haddu (Addu/Adad)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad) with the gods [**Teššub**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teshub) and [**Ba’alu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal) in Upper Mesopotamia and in Northern Syria, including both Hurrian and Hittite traditions.

*Chapter 7* moves to more recent periods, describing the figure of the god [**Adad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad) in the Neo-Assyrian period, displaying the actual pantheon of that culture, and locating the most important temples of this god in Assyria, Babylonia, Elam, and Persia, retracing the paths towards a new interpretation of this god in the literature of that time.

Some *indices* conclude the volume, referring to the main epithets of **Iškur-Adad** in the Sumerian and Akkadian dictionaries, adding at the very end a copy of the most important cuneiform texts related to this god.  

[The volume displays many different divine figures of the Syro-Mesopotamian pantheon, mostly focusing on the Storm-god, underlining how in many cases different gods were merged into one singular divine entity through a process of syncretism. The contribution represents a clear exemplification of the complexity of the Syro-Mesopotamian religious thought.]

TO divine figures

The perception of the complexity of the absolute embedded in polytheism in different divine figures, sometimes under a syncretistic view, is clearly exemplified in {B}R/Schwemer2001Wettergottgestalten, dealing with the figure of the Storm-god in the Syro-Mesopotamian pantheon.
