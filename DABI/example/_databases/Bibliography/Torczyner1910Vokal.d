The first part deals exclusively with the Hebrew segolates, the second (279-311) with the vocalism of the verbal system. Here the author utilizes at first only WSem. data to show that at the basis of verbal finite forms in Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic there is *not* just *one*, *but three* fundamental vocalic patterns: with the help of Akkadian, which is now introduced and fully utilized (290-309), the three patterns can be described as *qatal*, *qi/uti/ul*, *qati/ul*. Thus for example every derived Akk. stem contains all three patterns in the three tenses, e.g. in the D *uqa&#7789;&#7789;al*, *qu&#7789;&#7789;ul*, *uqa&#7789;&#7789;il*. The second main conclusion is that vocalization is irrelevant for determining the voice, and the criterion is instead the position of the subject -if prefixed, the form is active, if suffixed, passive. This means that there are no transitive or intransitive roots, that the vowel is indeed of little weight in Semitic morphology, that Semitic was originally agglutinative (298 f.). Other points affecting Akk. are discussed by way of appendix (300-9): the last vowel *u* is originary in the permansive and imperative D, not derived from *a*; of the derived stems, D and &#352; seem to be older; Akk. is the most archaic language (morphologically) and should receive more attention in comparative Semitics.
