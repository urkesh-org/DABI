Criticism of Ungnad's interpretation of the t-stem as oppressing intention on the part of the agent. An analysis of texts of juridical interest leads the author to the conclusion that such semasiological differentiation between normal and t-stem must be rejected; he also points out that all of Ungnad's examples, and most t-forms elsewhere, occur in secondary clauses.
