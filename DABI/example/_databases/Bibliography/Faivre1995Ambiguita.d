TO experience; perception; touching presence

Eliade often <<gives the impression of positing the existence of something non-temporal, eternal, existent 'in itself', independently of the experience that humans can have of it>>, which is a <<solipsistic proposal>> (p. 366). It follows that this type of research belongs <<less to the history of religions than to the study of the Imaginary>> (p. 367). In other words, there is <<an underlying ontology>> (p. 368), which follows a concept of <<Nature... which... evokes most of all the traces of a rural imagination, especially from Central Europe>> (p. 369).

[My effort to distinguish between perception and the perceived (between "touched" and "touching presence") seeks to avoid this problem.]
