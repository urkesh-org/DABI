A new phoneme &#7827; (as in Arabic *&#7827;&#257;*) is postulated for Old Babylonian on the basis of spellings in the Code of Hammurapi and private letters and contracts (though not royal letters) which occur in the following manner: written [zz] for phonemic /zz/ and /&#7779;&#7779;/, and written [z] for /ss/ and /&#7827;&#7827;/ as well as for /z/.
