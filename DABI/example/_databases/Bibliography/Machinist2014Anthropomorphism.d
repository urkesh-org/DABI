This article has some ambitious goals: it opens with some remarks about anthropomorphism in religion as a whole, then it surveys the presence of various forms of anthropomorphism in Mesopotamian religion - also (but not exclusively) by analysing three Mesopotamian mythic compositions (*Enuma Elish*, *Anzu* and *Erra*). Finally, it widens the topic by comparing the Mesopotamian world with examples taken from the Hebrew Bible.

Machinist identifies the origin of anthropomorphism in religion in the human need to bridge the gap existing with the divine sphere, which leads humans to use the experiences and the world they know to understand the divine: "When this effort centers on **understanding the divine through the human, we may speak of it as anthropomorphism**" (p. 67). Anthropomorphism, then, can take three shapes: 1. physical (the deity looks like a human or part of a human); 2. functional (the god/goddess behaves like a human); 3. emotional (the deity shows emotions that are normally found in humans).

Machinist provides an analysis of ancient Mesopotamian sources (both written and visual) looking for "some possible guesses, if not conclusions, about the nature, representation, and conceptualization of divinity in Mesopotamia, and the place of anthropomorphism in it" (p. 72). Interestingly, Machinist reviews the main theories on anthropomorphism in ancient Mesopotamia put forward by some of the most reknowned scholars, such as Jacobsen and Wiggerman.

In offering an analysis of the three Mesopotamian myths, the scholar comes to the conclusion that "**the borderline between anthropomorphism and non-anthropomorphism is regularly a fine and porous one** (...) since we find both monster/demons and gods overlapping and sharing at a number of points in each other's properties. **Furthermore, this borderline is for our myths not statically fine and porous; it is dynamically so**" (p. 95).

Machinist concludes his article with "a modest look, by way of conclusion, at the Hebrew Bible. The latter represents, of course, a Near Eastern religio-literary tradition in contact, both directly and indirectly, with Mesopotamia" (p. 95). He recognizes a mixture of anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic traits in the God of Israel, and investigates also the role of "other gods", monsters and demons as they appear in the Bible.
