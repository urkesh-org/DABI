TO Sumerian wisdom texts

The volume, after an introduction about the definition of Mesopotamian wisdom literature, collects many **wisdom texts** from ancient Sumer, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Hurrian compositions of different genres: instructions, counsels, proverbs, fables, and folktales. A final glossary offers to the reader a list of the main terms (in Sumerian, Akkadian, Hurrian, and Urartian) related to wisdom sources.
