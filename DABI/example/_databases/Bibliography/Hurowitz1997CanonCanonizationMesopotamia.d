Hurowitz surveys with a critical approach the various ways in which the terms "canon," "canonical," "canonicity" and "canonization" have been used by Assyriologists, questioning the applicability of such terms to the Ancient Mesopotamian reality.

The term "canon" started in the twenties to be used to refer to a series of Akkadian written compositions which aimed at copying, preserving, transmitting, and standardizing the form of older texts. von Soden, in particular, defined the so-called "canonical form" of a text as <<the recension of a scientific work or other literature which became for its contemporary surroundings the one authoritative work, with which nothing new could compete.>> (quotation at p. 2). Hurowitz highlights how, according to these Assyriologists, the term "canonical" bears no connotations of a religiously inspired text, nor does it imply any normative authority to the text. 

Overall, then, Hurowitz states that the modern usage of the terms "canonical" and "canonization" within the Mesopotamian studies are quite distinct from the religious notion of 'canon' applied to the Hebrew Bible. He denies that Mesopotamia produced a literary corpus analogous to the canons of the western religions - stating that <<the term **"canon"**, when applied to the Hebrew Bible (...) is a Christian term indicating **a closed group of texts which are divinely inspired, stem from a "mythological" period of history when God openly communicated with men, are normative for the community, and actually define that community.**>> (p. 4). Finally, the author maintains that the only Mesopotamian example which - in his view - fills some functional requirements of "canonical" in the religious, ecclesiastical sense (divine inspiration, large audience and normative function) is the Codex Hammurapi.
