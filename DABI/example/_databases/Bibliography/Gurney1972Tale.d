TO Tale of the Poor Man of Nippur

This paper, continuation of {B}R/Gurney1956Tale, offers the edition of the Mesopotamian composition known as the ***Tale of the Poor Man of Nippur***, according to the text from tablets found at Sultantepe, ancient site in Anatolia. 

[The text here edited exemplifies how a composition originally written in Mesopotamia was copied and re-interpreted outside its birthplace, in this case in ancient Anatolia, showing the process of transmission of Mesopotamian wisdom literature.]
