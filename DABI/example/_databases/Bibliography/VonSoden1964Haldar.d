A rebuke of Haldar&#39;s arguments on the following grounds: (l) if no distinction is made among the functions of the tenses, then one could translate with complete indifference for the forms which are actually found in the texts; (2) the choice of the material is superficial; (3) some of the translations are arbitrary and partial; (4) there is a great number of factual mistakes of reading and grammar (particularly showing that the preterite is never used for the future).
