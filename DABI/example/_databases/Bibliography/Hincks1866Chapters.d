A "dogmatic" and "illustrative" grammar is not yet possible because of the strong disagreement on basic methodological presuppositions especially with respect to Oppert and M&eacute;nant; hence only two chapters are presented here with ample and justificatory evidence of the author's views, and with criticisms of other scholars' views. The first chapter is on the permansive, for which the following definition (485) is basic: "the verbal forms belonging to each conjugation may be divided into two great classes, which I call permansive and mutative. The former denotes continuance in the state which the verb signifies in that conjugation; the latter denotes change into that state". The permansive is not to be confused with a participle, but is rather a tense (486), at least in the sense that it is "a word which includes in itself a pronominal subject, a copula and a predicate" (49l); it is used to describe permanent features, and for the passive (488 f.). Several examples are then quoted and analyzed as permansive. - The second chapter is on the noun, and touches on internal inflection ("forms" of the noun) but deals especially with external inflection: it may be noted that "first, second and third case" are preferred to nominative, genitive, accusative because the latter are considered misleading. - The article is concluded by an appendix on the pronominal suffixes. [This is the last article written by HINCKS and like the other important article of 1855-56 is worthy of being considered one of the few classics of Akkadian grammar with lasting value. For an appreciation of HINCKS, and a preliminary bibliography of his writings see C. ADLER, *JAOS* 13 (1889) ccxcvi-ccci.]
