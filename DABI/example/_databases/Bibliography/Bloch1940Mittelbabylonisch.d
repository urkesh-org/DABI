After a few remarks of phonology (&#353;t used promiscuously next to lt, dropping of mimation and consequent hypercorrection in the use of CVm signs anywhere in word final position) analyzes in detail verb, preposition and conjuction. The most important features which Bloch singles out as typically MB are: subjunctive of the 3 sg. fem. permansice (*parsatu*), occasional assimilation fe/i in verbal forms with i in last syllable (*lilebbi&#353;* next to *lilabbi&#353;*, pp. 309-11, 315, 317, 388 f., 323, 324, 337 f.), lack of assimilation in the type *iddim&#353;u*, lack of vocalic syncope in fret. B I/w (*&#363;&#353;ib&#363;* as regular type), in last weak verbs the final vowel is regularly short and contraction (irdE for irdiam) is also regular, the use of ki as a conjunction and as an emphatic particle instead of *-ma*. Of general interest for Akkadian grammar is especially the discussion about lenghtening of middle radical in the present (pp. 311-13, 329 f.), and of last radical in verbs middle weak (333 f.).
