A detailed and comprehensive monograph, including: a description of the means used for the decypherment, with a special discussion of the syllabaries (4-60); a list of syllabic and logographic values with a discussion of polyphony (61-115); an analysis of the lexicon (177-95) and a complete grammar (195-312) with an excursus on PN's (115-77); a set of conclusions to show the validity of the decypherment (312-38) and finally, by way of appendix, an anthology of texts (339-69), and a glossary (370-86). - The grammar is divided in the usual way: phonology (195-207), morphology (208-96, 390-92) and syntax (296-312). Given the "apologetic" goal of the article (to justify the validity of the decypherment) much of the material is comparative in nature, in that it is meant to establish the Semitic character of the language; but it also has the advantage of a richer exemplification than in previous grammars, which in turn allows often for a more precise statement of the rules. With respect to the verbal tenses he follows OPPERT vs. HINCKS. A special mention deserves the syntax, which represents the most extensive treatement to date.
