After a tabulation of 39 pairs ob preterite/present N with final vowesl *u/u* or *i/i* the conclusion is drawn that the vocalization of the N stem and that of B are identical except for two cases, which are emphasized in the following scheme:
B i/i. u/u. a/a. u/a
N u/u u/u *i*/a *i*/a.
The innovative element is the *i* of the preterite, a fact which implies that the non-innovative element (i. e. the present) must be traced back to Primitive Semitic.
