The *t*-form occurs in complementary distribution with other forms,
hence it must have specific functions; these are described under
three main headings. (1) The *t*-form as a *tense* in coordinated clauses: it occurs normally after preterites and before the present,
thus serving "to link the past to the present," and denoting "the
action which has just been performed and still affects the situation" (p. 312); the best translation is by means of an English perfect. A simple preterite is often found instead of the *t*-Form when
there is a negation ( 313-16), with certain verbs like *ba&#353;&#363;* (317),
when followed by a dative personal suffix (318, 332). But the *t*-form
is not properly a tense because the t element is found also in the
imperative, prohibitive and precative (319)-— (2 ) The *t*-form as a
*relative-tense* in subordinate clauses: it functions in a similar
way as in coordinate sentences, in that it "refers to the action
which, seen from the speaker's point of view, has just been performed
and is still of actual interest" (32). Thus it serves to express the
consecutio temporum as a past perfect or a future perfect. — (3) The
*t*-form as an *aspect*: the *t* infixed to the present and also to the
preterite may have the objective function of modifying the meaning
of the root (unlike the tense *t*-form which defines simply the point
in time). The functions are two: reflexive - reciprocal (323 f.) and
more frequently separative which "denotes a movement from a fixed
point in the direction of an unspecified goal" (324); an extensive documentation arranged alphabetically by verb follows. - In the conclusions, the various functions of the *t*-form are derived from the basic
Semitic function as a reciprocal-reflexive, the productivity of the
separative function being justified on the basis of an influnece
of the Sumerian prefix *ba-*. -It may be noted that while no term is
given to the tense-function in the title, the term "aorist" is introduced on p. 321 and then used regularly in the article.
