TO origin of religion; prehistoric religion

"How and when did religions originate? The study of prehistoric art is
revolutionizing our knowledge of prehistoric religions. The rock art
sites have been places of worship and tribal identity for millennia,
serving as archives of myths, beliefs and rites, all of which evolved,
diversified and acquired regional and ethnic features. Visual art,
however, is not the earliest evidence of the presence of religion.
Archeological discoveries of burial customs and burial goods
accompanying the dead in their journey to the other world, and newly
discovered prehistoric shrines, reveal concepts and beliefs going back
even before the origins of art. When and how were the first religious
concepts and rituals conceived? And how did religions acquire their
present shape? As presented in this book, the evolution of archeological and
anthropological evidence and analysis contribute a
new look to the origins and history of religion." [Editor's summary]
