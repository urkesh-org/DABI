A detailed list of occurrences, leading up to the conclusion that the marker -*u* is used when the corresponding indicative ends with the third radical, and the marker -*ni* when “the indicative exhibits an affix after the third radical.” “The forms which show both -*u* and -*ni* are relatively rare and must be explained as a later evolution” (27). The article ends with comparative remarks with the Babylonian and Middle Assyrian subjunctive, of which the Babylonian would be the most ambiguous, and the Middle Assyriab the clearest.
