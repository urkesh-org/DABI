Follows very clpsely, for the grammatical theory, OPPERT 1860 "Elements"
of which it does not even consider, however, the remarks on phonology.
On the other hand textual references are numerous, and are quoted both in
cuneiform and transliteration; it also includes a section on writing
and an anthology of texts. But the main advantage of the work is the
abundance of bibliographical references, which trace back every important grammatical notion to its first formulation in the early stages
of decypherment.
