TO Babylonian; synchronic analysis

The aim of this volume is <<to provide a description of Babylonian which may serve both as a systematic theoretical statement of the structure of the language, and as a guide towards a better understanding of the textual record>> (p. VIII). The Grammar analyzes mostly Old Babylonian in a synchronic way, but it also quotes examples from later periods when Old Babylonian instances are lacking; it is also enriched by several sections which refer to the historical background of specific phenomena.
