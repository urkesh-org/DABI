MacDonald's paper explicitly argues that <<efforts to understand historically remote patterns of thought are driven away from their original meaning if the investigation focuses on reconstruction of concepts, instead of cognitive 'complexes'.>> (p. 82) Drawing on research conducted by previous scholars on the cultures of Ancient Greece, Israel, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Etruria, it applies comparative analyses of the semantic fields of spatial and temporal terms, and it investigates how these terms are shaped by their relation to the sphere of the sacred. 

Through a textual and lexical analysis of the ancient cultures taken into consideration in this article, MacDonald challenges the long-standing, usually unexamined opposition between cyclical time and linear time - and he proposes to consider three super-ordinate timeframes - the cyclical, the linear and the static - each of which composed of lower-order cycles (days, lunar months, and seasons). 

Then, the author highlights how neither in the Mesopotamian nor in the Egyptian documentary evidence can one find the concept of "space" - thus he infers that while studying these culture we should take into consideration not our moderns concepts, but rather the super-ordinate spatial frames which reflect better their cultures' ideas about the structure of the world.
