The *&#353;* prefix cannot be considered as exclusively causative, for it has another important function as elative, "in the broader sense of some specially emphasized connotation" (p. 472). Thus nominal forms with *&#353;* express "intensification of the basic meaning" of adjectival bases, as with the pair *rab&#363;* "great" ~ *&#353;urb&#363;* "supreme" (&#167; 4). The verbal correlative of this form is the so-called &#352;/D stem, which is in reality the factitive (D) of the elative, so that *u&#353;rabbi* means "he made supreme" while *u&#353;arbi* is simply "he made great" (&#167; 7, &#167; 3). As a non-causative, the prefix may also be used in a declarative connotation (*u&#353;albar*, "he becomes old," &#167; 5), and as a "lexical element or base-complement" to form denominatives with quadri-consonantal bases "which, however, are not quadriradicals (*u&#353;harrar* "he becomes old," &#167; 6).
