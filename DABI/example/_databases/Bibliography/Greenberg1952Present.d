1. Analysis of the Akkadian writing system shows that the middle
radical *was* geminated in the present; objections to the contrary
are unfounded and derived from biased a-priori considerations. Gemination in the present occurs also in Ethiopic (*yan&auml;ggar*), Cananite (Amarna *tillak&#363;na*), Berber ("habitual" *igattal*), Bedauye
(*akantib*) and in a sense ancient Egyptian (imperfective partiple
*mrr* vs. perfective participle *mr*). 2. Another distinguishing trait
between present and preterite found, outside of Akk., in Beber, Bedauye, some Cushitic and Chad languages, and perhaps South Arabic,
is the contrast *a* (present) / *i* (preterite) in the last syllable of
the pattern. 3. Negative command is formed by means of the present
in Akk., Berber, Bedayye, Cushitic. 4. Prefixed or infixed *t* is
used to form the present in Berber and Bedauye and a related tense
for recently completed action ("perfect") in Akk. â€” All this indicates that the present is a Proto-Afro-Asiatic feature.

In *JAOS* 73 (1553) 164-66 W. LESLAU wrote a rejoinder entitled "The
Imperfect in South-East Semitic", to show that the Proto-Ethiopic
present (based on South-Ethiopic) was not geminated. Immediately
following, on p. 167 f., GREENBERG replied, elaborating his reasons
for Proto-Ethiopic *yaq&auml;ttal*.
