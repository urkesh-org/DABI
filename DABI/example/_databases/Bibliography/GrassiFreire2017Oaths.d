This article aims to investigate the role of perception, beliefs, and norms internalised by relevant social actors within the context of foreign relations in the ancient Near East. The author focuses in particular on covenant treaties, defined as «a highly stylised ceremonial performance of a treaty or agreement» which he considers to be the most obvious link between oaths and curses (p. 664).

Grassi Freire firstly discusses the practice of covenanting and the stylised format of a covenant treaty. Then, he discusses the background of covenantal oaths and curses, and the notion of covenant-breaking as a sin that attracts divine curses. Afterwards the author analyzes the representative position of kings in the execution of oaths and curses, to conclude with a discussion on the role played by prophets in linking specific curses (or blessings) to specific patterns of political behaviour.
