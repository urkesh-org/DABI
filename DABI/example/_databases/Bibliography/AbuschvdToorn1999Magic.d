This volume brings together the proceedings of a conference on Mesopotamian magic and divination which was held in 1995 at the 'Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences': the result is a most useful collection of some significant contributions to the study of Mesopotamian magic - of which we provide a very short synthesis below.

The book opens with an article by W. van Binsbergen and F. Wiggermann's ("Magic in history: A theoretical perspective, and its application to ancient Mesopotamia", pp. 1-34) in which the authors discuss the role of magic within the Mesopotamian society. In "The poetry of magic," (pp. 35-48). N. Veldhuis offers an analysis of various Old-Babylonian incantations used in magic rituals in order to influence the course of the earthly events. M.J. Geller's "Freud and Mesopotamian magic" (pp. 49-55) attempts to assess the psychological impact of magic both on Mesopotamian society as a whole, and on the individual's psyche. A similar topic is the center of the following article, written by M. Stol ("Psychosomatic suffering in ancient Mesopotamia," pp. 57-68). J.A. Scurlock's "Physician, Exorcist, Conjurer, Magician: A Tale of Two Healing Professionals" (pp.69-79) investigates and tries to better delineate the two professions attested in ancient Mesopotamia - that of the physician and of the pharmacist. 

Tz. Abusch, "Witchcraft and the anger of the personal god" (pp. 83-121) describes how different evils and calamities that were originally attributed to entities of the divine realm, especially to the anger of the personal god, came to be interpreted as induced by witches. In "How the Babylonians protected themselves against calamities announced by omens" (pp. 123-129), S.M. Maul demonstrates how each stage of the Mesopotamian mental construction of evil and protection against evil had its material counterpart in the *namburbi* ritual procedures. A. Livingstone's "The magic of time" (pp. 131-137) examines some temporal expressions found in magical texts, while K. van der Toorn ("Magic at the cradle: A reassessment", pp. 139-147) focuses on a small group of incantations against crying babies. E. A. Braun-Holzinger, in "Apotropaic figures at Mesopotamian temples in the third and second millennia" (pp. 149-172) analyzes the apotropaic figures set up at the facades of Mesopotamian public buildings; in "The poetics of spells: Language and structure in Aramaic incantations of Late Antiquity. 1: The divorce formula and its ramifications" (pp. 173-195) 

Sh. Shaked discusses the magical formulae attested in divorce spells used to drive away demons from possessed patients. In her article "Interrelations between Mandaic lead rolls and incantation bowls" (pp. 197-209) Ch. Miiller-Kessler suggests that a continuation of an older Babylonian magical tradition may be recognized in some parts of these Mandaic magic texts of Late Antiquity. I.L. Finkel's  "On some dog, snake and scorpion incantations" (pp. 213-250) offers the edition for 16 Old- and Late-Babylonian incantations against venomous and dangerous creatures. A. Cavigneaux, "A scholar's library in Meturan? With an edition of the tablet H 72 (Textes de Tell Haddad VII)" (pp.251-273) examines the Old-Babylonian literary lot excavated in Me-turan - while W.W. Hallo, in "More incantations and rituals from the Yale Babylonian Collection" (pp. 275-289) offers editions with copies of two Old-Babylonian Lamastu-incantations and a late astronomical omen tablet. The last contribution to this volume is W.G. Lambert's "Marduk's Address to the Demons" (pp. 291-296), in which the scholar outlines and analyzes in detail the different sections of the text.
