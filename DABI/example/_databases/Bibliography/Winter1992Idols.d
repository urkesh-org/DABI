Winter analyzes sculptural images of rulers in ancient Mesopotamia which were subject to complex rituals of consecration, installation, and maintenance, as a result of which they were deemed to be living manifestations, empowered to act and speak on a ruler's behalf. The author aims to demonstrate that, at least in the specific chronological period analyzed in the article (ca. 2100-2000 BCE), consecrated images were intended to be placed in temple sanctuaries or in funerary chapels, and that royal images were introduced into worship in temples dedicated to the living ruler.
