The author discusses dedicatory inscriptions as examples of communication with the divine. The paper argues that divinatory inscriptions communicate with the god(s) not only by means of the written message they carry, but also by means of their very existence: the materiality and presence in the sanctuary, close to the divine presence.

The author considers divinatory inscriptions as forms of both "vertical communication" (i.e., with the divine, based on the assumption that deities dwell in heaven) and "horizontal communication" (i.e., with the surrounding society), and uses the dedicatory inscriptions which were found in the Yahwistic sanctuary from the Persian and Hellenistic Period excavated on Mount Gerizim (Nablus) as a case-study.

The authors also consider the function of dedicatory inscription as a proxy for its donor: as such, the inscription becomes the eternal presence which allows for a perpetual display of the giver's ritual participation and devotion.
