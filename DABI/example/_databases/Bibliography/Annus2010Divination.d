This collection of papers stems from the fifth annual University of Chicago Oriental Institute Seminar, held in 2009.  The title of the book is somewhat a misnomer; nearly every paper is concerned with divination and the interpretation of signs in Mesopotamia, understandable since a significant portion of sources concerning these topics in antiquity stems from there.  There is also one paper on China (Edward L Shaughnessy, ‘Arousing Images: The Poetry of Divination and the Divination of Poetry’), and two on the classical world (James Allen, ‘Greek Philosophy and Signs’, and John Jacobs, Traces of the Omen Series Šumma izbu in Cicero, De divinatione).  In fact, these three papers are not at all out of place, but are indispensable in providing a comparative context for the large Mesopotamian corpus and its influence on Greek and Roman divination.     

Amar Annus sets the stage in this work by defining the nature and status of omen sciences in the ancient world.  The goal of this volume is to study omen literature as a component of the society in which it was created, which is not unlike how Giorgio Buccellati sees the nature of religion in Mesopotamia.  The remainder of the volume has four sections, the first of which, ‘Theories of Divination and Signs’, has topics such as;  form and reasoning in Babylonian divination (Rochberg), cognitive theory in extispicy rituals (Koch), and theory and knowledge and the practice of celestial divination (Veldhuis).  The second section, ‘Hermenuetics of Sign Interpretation’, has topics concerning Mesopotamian text commentaries and divinatory texts (Frahm), the nature of script and interpretation (Noegel), calculating the stipulated term in extispicy (Heebel), divine presence and interpretation in divination (Winitzer), and physiognomy (Bock).  The third section, ‘History of Sign Interpretation’, includes papers concerned with liver divination (Richardson), divination and oracles in Neo-Assyrian royal ideology (Jean), and the relationship of prophecy and divination (Scurlock).  The last section, ‘Response’, has a single paper by Nissinen which attempts a broad summary by studying the relationship of prophecy and omen divination.  

One might be surprised to find that we know so little about the nature of divination at Ugarit on the Syrian coast, as well as biblical Israel, which practiced prophecy and some types of divination (i.e. the urim and thumin), although most divinatory practices were condemned.
