TO false prophets

The main purpose of this contribution consists in the historical analysis of the figure of **false prophets** in the Hebrew Bible and in the Ancient Near East: the author sketches the common features of these kind of prophets who were considered “false” basically because they did not vehiculated a message agreeable to the God(s) or to the kings, or even to the sense of common people. 

[The figure of “false prophets” is quite well known for what concerns the biblical world; similar examples from the Ancient Near East, usually less familiar, are here presented by the author with the carefulness of contextualising each figure in its specific chronological and geographical background.]
