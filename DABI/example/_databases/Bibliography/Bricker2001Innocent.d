TO Innocent suffering; theodicy; Egyptian literature

There are many studies exploring the idea of **innocent suffering** and the concept of **theodicy** as it occurs in the literature of ancient Mesopotamia and Israel, but this is not the case with ancient Egyptian literature. This article explores the factors in Egyptian culture that led to the exclusion of theodicy and the idea of innocent suffering from their world view and literature. Bricker bases his analysis on van Soden's four criteria for theodicy: (1) a clear sense of right and wrong, so that a sufferer could reasonably claim to be suffering undeservedly; (2) significant individual worth, so that personal suffering must be justified; (3) minimal competition within the godhead or pantheon, so that suffering cannot be blamed on one deity due to human loyalty to another; and (4) a limited view of judgment in the afterlife. 

He concludes that **"theodicy is not an appropriate category for discussion of Egyptian literature due to the Egyptian view of a judgement in post-mortem existence."** Furthermore, "in Egypt the gods are almost never questioned or blamed for injustices. ... For the Egyptians, evil was generally associated with *isft*, 'disorder', the opposite of *ma'at*. Those who did not do or speak according to the standards of *ma'at* allowed disorder into their lives. For the Mesopotamians evil was often seen as a result of demonic activity, hence a result of living forces or beings. Even a 'friendly' personal god may allow suffering to occur in an individual's life if offended, so the rituals in Mesopotamian worship often functioned as appeasement so that suffering was avoided or halted."

TO theodicy; Job; disorder; evil

It is interesting that Egypt lacks an emphasis on theodicy, but for reasons diametrically opposed to Israel's. Whereas the Bible poses the question of innocent suffering, receives no response, and ends by situating YHWH above any justification, Egypt avoids the radical problem by associating evil with disorder. There is thus no "innocent" suffering, even when the exact cause of the disorder is unknown. ({B}R/Bricker2001Innocent).
