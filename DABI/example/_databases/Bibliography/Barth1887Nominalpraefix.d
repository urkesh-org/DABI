TO dissimilation; nominal patterns

The view that patterns with prefix *na*- belong with the passive (*niphal*) conjugation is refuted on the basis that many roots with such patterns are intransitive. In fact, they have the same functions as patterns with prefix *ma*-, *na*-, merely the expression of relationship of place, time and instrument. The explanation is that *na*- is dissimilated from *ma*- when the first or second syllable after *ma*- contains a labial: this rule is peculiar to Akkadian, and similar forms in Syriac, Hebrew and Arabic are rare and possibly loanwords.
