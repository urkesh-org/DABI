41. - The following new quadriradicals are added to the list of known roots: one double weak *&#353;ub&#275;&#39;u* "to attack," and others of unclear meaning (151-54). - 43. Tentatively one may also postulate a quadriradical *&#42;ne&#39;ell&#363;* "to look around (for something)," though it may also be a triradical *ne&#42;l&#363;* with irregular formations (156-58). - 50. "Ingressive-durative N-St&auml;mme von Verben mediae geminatae." Verbs of the type *naparruru* "to run away in all directions" have been considered as quadriradical by GOETZE 1945 "Heidel";  instead, they are triradicals with second and third radical (always a liquid) identical, and with lenghthening of: the middle radical in infinitive and stative, the last radical in the other cases (e.g. *ipparirru*). These roots occur normally in the N stem, and even more frequently in the Ntn stem, and they constitute a meaning class indicating movement not on a straight line. Perhaps to same group belongs also the root *mll* as in *immelil* "he danced," the imperative of which occurs however in the B stem: *melil* "dance!"
