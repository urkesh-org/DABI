TO Religious Drama; Sacred Marriage Drama; Battle Drama; fertility dramas; processions

Jacobsen’s article examines what **religious dramas** were meant to achieve, and the ways their meaning changed over time in Babylon. He considers the older materials regarding fertility dramas, especially the Sacred Marriage Drama, and the first millenium remnants of the fertility dramas and the Battle Drama.

The **Sacred Marriage Drama** is found in the cult of Tammuz/Dumuzi attested in protoliterate times in Uruk. Jacobsen proposes the existence of three other fertility dramas involving processions, based on textual fragments that seem to suggest that they were <<scripts>> for a performance. Jacobsen calls these the Mourning Drama, the Road of No Return Drama, and the Search and Fetching Drama. 

In the first millenium, relevant information comes mostly from cultic calendars and commentaries. This information is difficult to interpret, and fertility dramas no longer hold center-stage.  Jacobsen advances only the hypothesis that the the <<death and lament drama of Dumuzi seems very likely to have retained its purpose of strengthening emotional ties with the god—especially in the case of Dumuzi of the grain where the death of the god has in fact been brought about by his worshipers and where the rite of lament is therefore one of great ambivalence and covert guilt.>> (p. 75).

There is however a new form of drama, the **Battle drama**. As Jacobsen argues elsewhere ({B}R/Jacobsen1968Battle), it is unlikely that the Marduk-Tiamat battle derived from the everyday experience of Babylonians, and was probably imported. However, the battle between Babylon and the <<Sealand>>, *mat tamti*, was the chief conflict during the early half of the second millennium. This political-historical interpretation also explains why Enlil is given no role in *Enuma elish*: he represents the south, and therefore the enemy side. 
<<Although in some cases rooted in older fertility dramas, this new form comes to be the preferred vehicle for a new *political* drama celebrating and reaffirming the birth of the nation as a divine achievement that was from the beginning, in mythical time.>> (p. 77).

TO sacred marriage; cult

The dramas studied by Jacobsen represent the development of a primitive cult into a representational, “archaic” religion, especially visible in the example of sacred marriage: “representation rather than action by all; ...and consonant with the anthropomorphic view, the desired benefits are sought through psychological and social motivation, not by becoming the power and as it doing what it should do. We have moved from magic to a psychological theurgy.” (p. 68) In this stage, instead of the entire population participating in the action, as in Javanese fertility rituals, the king and his partner act for the whole of society, and the “powers with which they identify are personified, well-defined anthropomorph gods acting within a sociomorph pattern, that of marriage.” (p. 69). He further suggests that the older material describes the masculine god as the giver, and the female as receiving, while later texts interpret the goddess as source, and the god as receiver.
