Common Semitic had originally two verbal forms, characterized by number of syllables and, secondarily, by stress: a short form *y&aacute;qtul* for completed action, and a long form *yaqt&uacute;lu* for incomplete action. The coexistence of  both forms is proved by the fact that various traces in the historical languages show that the two forms are essentially indifferent with respect to mood; the data may be summarized graphically as follows, with parenthesis for infrequent attestation:

|                         | Akkad         | Hebrew        | Aram.         | Arabic        |
| ------------------------| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| y&aacute;qtul jussive   |       X       |       X       |               |       X       |
| y&aacute;qtul indicative|       X       |      (X)      |               |      (X)      |
|yaqt&uacute;lu indicative|      (X)      |        X      |       X       |       X       |
| yaqt&uacute;lu subjunct |       X       |        X      |       X       |       X       |

Akkadian *ika&#353;&#353;ad* and Geez *yaq&aacute;ttal* are both secondary: the first is "un nom d'agent conjugu&eacute; avec pr&eacute;fixe" (p. 50), while the second is a substitute for the long form *yat&aacute;la* which, due to phonological development, had become less distinctive with respect to the short form *y&aacute;qtel* (p. 58). For Akkadian note especially p. 48, where Saraw's view concerning the consonantal lengthening of the type *ikunn&#363;* is tentatively accepted.
