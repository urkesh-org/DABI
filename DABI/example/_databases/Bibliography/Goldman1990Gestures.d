This article analyses the iconographical representation of gestures in Assyrian reliefs and it provides a useful list of the conventional gestures (for a total of 35) that were most commonly represented in Assyrian art, as well as in some earlier Old Babylonian and Akkadian examples. The variety of iconographies described in this article indicate different emotions: piety, salutation, surrender, intercession, acknowledgment, humility, adoration, prayer, etc. The most documented are the devotional gestures, which might also be aligned with textual references (for example the so-called *laban appi* - the touching of the nose as a mark of prayer -, and the "lifting of the hand").
