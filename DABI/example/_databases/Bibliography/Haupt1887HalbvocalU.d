"Assyrian" [i.e. SB, NB, LB, NA] does not preserve anywhere Proto-Semitic *w*. What is sometime understood as *w* is in fact a labial [i.e.labio- dental] spirant *v*, and corresponds to original *m*, postvocalic *b* or intersonantic aleph, but not to original *w*. Instead, original *w* becomes aleph when initial or
intersonantic, while the diphthong *aw* becomes *&#244;* , written *&uuml;*. Most of the documentatio, based on
comparative considerations with other Semitic languages and on alternate forms of writing in
cuneiform, concerns: *m>v* disappearance of *m*, and ' > *m* if intersonantic (pp. 264-77). The author
concludes (277-85) by refuting the analysis given by others (esp. Zimmern) of possible examples in 
Assyrian of Proto-Semitic *w*.
