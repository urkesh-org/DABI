The author deals with a comparison between the religious ideology of **Syria-Palestine** in the Late Bronze Age (as reflected in the Ugaritic evidence) and the **Phoenician** religious tradition of the Iron Age, and focuses in this paper on some peculiar **religious aspects** attested in the documentation of [**Ugarit/Ras Shamra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit). The paper is introduced by a *caveat*: in the interpretation of ancient religious practices it is important to avoid a superimposition of **modern ideology** (stemming from the Judaeo-Christian milieu) on ancient texts produced by cultures <<who did not own or do not even have the term in question: religion>> (p. 525). 

A first statement is placed at the beginning of *paragraph 2*: <<In traditional societies (including those of ancient world), “religious” ideology is simply ideology. The sphere -- conceptual and practical -- which appears to us to be very distinct from the others, resulting from a categorization based on the dichotomy (which is very familiar to us) “sacred” / “profane” represents, on the other hand, in other societies, a total and totalizing dimension, organized according to criteria different from ours>> (p. 526). <<Other cultures thus reveal a *Weltanschauung* which encompasses not only the cosmogony and the principles of universal order, but also the political, social and economic architecture of the community of men>> (p. 526). It is impossible to detach in ancient world the religious and the socio-political spheres, two realities which strongly merged and interacted. 

According to the author, the ancient **polytheisms** are symbolic system based on a **structural complexity** and a specific **dynamism of interaction**: the action of gods was reflected on both a **social** and **individual** floor, and its expression is embedded in **mythology** and **cults**. Each specific god represented an aspect of the cosmic and natural reality and all the gods are systematized into an organic and structured **pantheon** reflecting the human sphere. 

The core contribution is a comparison of the Ugaritic pantheon with those of the Phoenician sites of [**Byblos**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byblos), [**Sidon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon), and [**Tyre**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon); furthermore, the author investigates also some **morphological aspects** of some gods, the origin and diffusion of **‘mythologems’** related to **dead and resurrected gods**, ending with a reflection about the **continuity/discontinuity** of religious ideology and cultic practices in antiquity.

*Paragraph 3* describes the structure of **Ugaritic pantheon**: *sub-paragraph 3.1* deals with a short history of the development of the main divine figures at **Ugarit**, structured in an organic system involving specific names, epithets, hierarchical relationships between gods,  genealogies, functions, alliances and antagonisms between gods, filiations, worshipping places (often mythical), gods’ prerogatives and spheres of influence. What seems to be striking in Ugaritic pantheon is the absence of a gods regarded and conceived as stronger than others: nevertheless, two gods can be placed at the top of the Ugaritic pantheon, i.e. the creator god [**Ilu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)) and the young and strong [**Baalu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal), the polyad god at Ugarit (also known as [**Haddou**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad)). After a passage dealing with the different interpretation of Baalu with other gods, the author presents the female figures of [**Athiratu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah) (Ilu’s consort) and of [**Anatu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anat), fighting to bring back Baalu’s (her brother) body from the Underworld. *Sub-paragraph 3.2* focuses on the aforementioned Phoenician cities, pointing out how we cannot relate on primary, textual sources of the 1st millennium BC, but only on later (Greek and Roman) second-hand reports. Giving the fact that each Phoenician city retained a **specific pantheon**, probably to mark to unique identity of each place, it is impossible to reconstruct a general ‘Phoenician pantheon’. Nevertheless, some common traits can be outlined: the existence of a main god, [**Baal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal) (also called [**Adon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adon)), and of a main goddess, [**Baalat**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Baalat). At **Byblos**, a city which got entertained many contacts with Egypt, the polyad goddess was [**Ashtart**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte), also called [**‘Baalat of Byblos’**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%E2%80%98alat_Gebal), identified with the Egyptian [**Hathor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor) and [**Isis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis). Baal was also worshipped at Byblos (later called in Classical sources [**Adonis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adon)), and received also some specific epithets, like [**Baal Shamem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baalshamin) (connected to the sky), and **Baal Addir** (‘Mighty Lord’), a chthonian entity. At **Sidon**, already in the Late Bronze Age, it is attested the god **diškur** (probably to be assimilated to the Ugaritic Baalu), the **Storm god**, together with **Ashtart**; during the Iron Age, the sources mention the couple **‘Baal of Sidon’** and again Ashtart, while the polyad god can be recognized with [**Eshmun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshmun), a warrior deity (elsewhere also an **healing god**, whose name is also attested on a New Kingdom Egyptian medical papyrus [[*London Medical Papyrus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Medical_Papyrus)]). At **Tyre**, it is attested a Storm god (in the 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC) and the god [**Melqart**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melqart), literally ‘the king of the city’, the protector of the town.

TO ‘religion’

As stressed by G. Buccellati, ‘religion’ is a term difficult to be defined as it was perceived in ancient Mesopotamian mindset: a discussion on this topic is offered in {B}Mes-rel/Xella2014Dieux in its introductory note on the ancient concept of ‘religion’, not well defined in antiquity as it is nowadays, helping in understanding how to approach ancient polytheism and religious thought, avoiding any superimposition of modern terminology or concepts.

As stressed by G. Buccellati in this section, <<gods are liable to death>>: on this topic, see {B}Mes-rel/Xella2014Dieux, dealing with ‘dead and resurrected gods’ (*Paragraph 2*).

TO pantheon

G. Buccellati describes in section 5.1 the dynamic nature of ancient Mesopotamian polytheism, underlining how this dynamism is well represented in the structure of pantheon, in art, myths, and hierarchy: on this topic, see {B}Mes-rel/Xella2014Dieux, describing Syro-Palestine divinities in a similar way, adding a list of gods and goddesses composing the basic structure of the local pantheon(s).

TO dying gods

G. Buccellati tells about the ‘disappearance’ or ‘death’ of gods in ancient Mesopotamian religious literature (see section 5.1, point 6): on this topic, see {B}Mes-rel/Xella2014Dieux, dealing with ‘dead and resurrected gods’ (*Paragraph 2*).
