1. The ending of the accusative is originally -a&, i.e. a with nosalizaiton (-anym). The same 
nasals in a demonstrative sense are found in particles (e.g. Akkadan anna "yes," umma for direct 
speech), in the marker for determination (raimation in a prehistoric stage of Akkadian) in the prefixes 
of nominal patterns (which appear as frozen genitive constructions, esp. participles in mu- and nomina 
loci in ma- meaning "that-of-[the verbal concept]," as well as in suffixes (gentilies like A&#353;&#353;r-a m-ya 
"the-one- of-A&#353;&#353;ur," ordinals, abstract -u&-t-&-aw-t-&-am-t-, the plural -a&n-, the diminutive -a&n-), 
in postpositions (the terminative -u&m, the conjunctive and emphatic -ma), in prepositions (ina, ana), 
in verbal moods (the ventive, precative, asseverative, here with change from nasal to liquid), in interrogative 
(Akk.-'&-a' & am as well as negative pratices (prohibitive ay-). 2. The element s, phonologically 
connected with h/', is also demonstrative in nature and is found in interjections, personal
pronouns, determinative pronouns, the terminative -i&#353;, adjectival patterns &#353;aqtal/'aqtal, the conditional
conjunction &#353;umma/ 'im. 3. The element t/d has demonstrative functions in the Arabic determinative
pronoun, the feminine, pronouns, prepositions (itti), conjunctions. 4. The element k/g has demonstrative functions in pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions (ki). - The same elements are also found substantivized 
(e.g. &#353; in &#353;umu "that- of-someone," "name") and verbalized (in the stem affixes). The exemplification is from Hamito-Semitic and Smaerian (!). [Methodologically, the article is indicative of
an exaggerate tendency to reduce everything to few proto-forms, with a cavalier attitude toward
phonological and other rules.]
