The author presents a review of the book by [H. Richard Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Richard_Niebuhr), [*The Kingdom of God in America*](https://books.google.it/books?id=w6UyX8FcGf0C&printsec=frontcover&hl=it&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false), New York: Harper, 1959 (first edition: 1937).

The basic question advanced by the author is the following: <<What was the impact of the Bible on this evolution [i.e. the history of the faith of American Protestants]?>> (p. 189).

The answer is that this impact was not so considerable, and the explanation is given under these respects: <<Niebuhr thinks (pp. 172-76) that the prevalence of the first element, the **objective criterion** [of God’s Word], which occurred after moments of religious awakening, coincides with an institutionalist stiffening of the worst kind, against which today’s Protestantism must guard>> (p. 190; English translation by mDP). 

[This paper offers an example of how the interpretation of the Bible could (or could not) influence modern societies (in this case, American Protestantism).]
