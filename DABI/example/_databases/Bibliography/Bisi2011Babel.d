TO Tower of Babel


An analysis of the biblical story of the tower of Babel, seen as the condemnation of the builders who transgress <<the biblical law for which man can name everything, but not himself>> (p. 189), seeming thus to <<arrive, naming himself, to a direct link with his own essence, and clumsily imitate in this way the creative action of God>> (p. 191). Quoting Petrosino: <<one wanted to mimic the Word with a language>>, while the divine intervention reaffirms <<the essential, creaturely link between the unicity of the Word and the unique multiplicity of words>> (p. 192).

TO Tower of Babel, Divine anger

In the biblical perspective, divine wrath is the consequence of an opposition between two wills. For Gonzalez, it also has a pedagogical meaning: {B}R/Gonzalez2015Colere.
