Spinoza proposes a modern interpretation of the absolute which is conceived in a way that is not dissimilar with polytheism. The extreme effort to maintain the purity of the absolute (to the point that divine intervention in history is denied explicitly, starting with creation) seems to work against the fragmentation of the absolute. The absolute has no face, not one nor many. But one observes that in the first place the notion of necessity inherent in a structural manner in the absolute recalls us to the amorphous and impersonal concept of fate that the Greeks called precisely "necessity" (ananke).

It is important to distinguish clearly between human perception and the presumed existence of the object or subject that causes that perception. Too close a connection between the two leads Faivre to critique Eliade. Buccellati proposes a way out of the impasse with his distinction between "touched" and "touching". See: {B}R/Faivre1995Ambiguita.

A common idea (for instance in {B}R/Bettini2014Polytheism) holds that polytheism is more tolerant and less violent than monotheism. However, the two different religious views cannot be compared "straight across" and used for their civil effects. They differ at the level of grammatical structure, as it were, between transitive and intransitive verbs.

Whether or not there is an "affecting presence" (God) who reveals himself, the hidden reality (the "toucher") can only be accessed through human perception (the "touched"). Clarity on this point aids in avoiding sterile arguments that affirm or deny certainty about the nature and character of the "affecting presence", and redirects attention to the historical data that are undeniable. See Faivre's critique of Eliade, and Buccellati's alternative proposal: {B}R/Faivre1995Ambiguita.
