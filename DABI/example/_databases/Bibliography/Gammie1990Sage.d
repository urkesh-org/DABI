TO sage in Israel and Mesopotamia

<<“This volume seeks to make a modest contribution to the intellectual and social history of Israel and the ancient Near East. As the title of the volume suggests, the focus is upon those **wise men and women** in ancient Israel who composed Israel’s wisdom literature, counseled her kings, and consoled -- and sought to guide -- her people on the basis of Israel’s sapiential tradition” (*from the Preface*). With 37 contributions from an international pool of authors, each of whom is known for his/her contributions in the area assigned, the volume is intended to provide comprehensive coverage of the state of research and point to further direction for investigation>> (from [editor’s webpage](https://www.eisenbrauns.org/books/titles/978-1-57506-225-9.html))

[This miscellanea collects many contributions describing **how sages where defined and perceived in ancient Israel**, and how they actually acted on a cultural, social and political level, presenting also a comparative approach on **ancient Mesopotamia**.]
