TO Divine wrath; Suffering Just Man; Ludlul; magic

While the concept of the <<suffering just man>> has been criticized when used to refer to Mesopotamian literature, Ziegler believes it is a useful concept because whether or not the sufferer was actually faultless, there are several texts in which the author believes in his faultlessness. In particular, Ludlul II 33-36 supports this interpretation: the author writes that <<what is good may displease the god!>> There is no clarity about why the god is angry; yet apparently it is he who is crushing the <<suffering just man>>. Ziegler also offers an extended catalog of symptoms of divine displeasure in several Mesopotamian texts.

Her analysis of suffering and reintegration through **magic** acts is in accord with Buccellatiâ€™s description in 13.2. Note however that Ziegler describes the relationship between the suffering just and the gods in terms that seem close to what Buccellati affirms to be exclusively biblical (13.3). The author of Ludlul, for instance, **offers thanks** to the god for having been healed. See also ({B}R/Buccellati2020Job).
