On the basis of data from all branches of the Afro-Asiatic family
a set of suffixes *n/t/n* is isolated, of which *n* signals the masculine
singular, *t* the feminine sing., and *n* the plural. In Akkadian traces
of this set are found in the numeral :one" *i&#353;t&#275;n/i&#353;t&#275;t* (p. 319), and
in the plural (masculine) *-&#257;n* (p. 321).
