Primarily on the basis of NB documentation, but also CH, the view is advanced that forms without *t* describe the action as occurring through external, forms with *t* through internal impulse, so that *iddin* means "he gave because external circumstances made him to" *ittadin* "he gave because he felt in himself the impulse to do so" (p. 253). The connotation of external obligation may often remain untranslated, so that the simple verb may be used to translate the form without *t*, whereas the translation normally must bring out the connotation of intentionality for the t-forms (p. 255). In a sequence of verbs expressing intentionality it is sufficient if only one of them occurs in the t- forms (p. 254).
