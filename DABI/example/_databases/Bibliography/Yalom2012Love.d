TO Meaning; patterns; biological substrate

Yalom affirms that <<We are meaning-seeking creatures. Biologically, our nervous systems are organized in such a way that the brain automatically clusters incoming stimuli into configurations. Meaning also provides a sense of mastery: feeling helpless and confused in the face of random, unpatterned events, we seek to order them and, in so doing, gain a sense of control over them. Even more important, meaning gives birth to values and, hence, to a code of behavior: thus the answer to why questions (Why do I live?) supplies an answer to how questions (How do I live?).>> p. 34

The biological substrate affirmed by Yalom is coherent with the religious behavior of humans: an attempt to order random events and thereby gain control over them. The alternative presented in biblical monotheism is a radically different perspective, attending, within apparent randomness, to a <<mystery>>, a personal actor, who is eventually revealed as a lover. 

Yalom also mentions what he considers a two-sided illusion common to most humans: the belief that one is special, and therefore immune to the ordinary disasters of life (death, in particular); and the belief that there is a savior, <<Though we may falter, grow ill, though we may arrive at the very edge of life, there is, we are convinced, a looming, omnipotent servant who will always bring us back.>> p. 34 See {B}R/Yalom2012Love.
