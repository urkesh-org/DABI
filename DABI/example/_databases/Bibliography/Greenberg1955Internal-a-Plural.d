The vowel *a* occurs frequently as plural marker
in all branches of the Afro-asiatic group:
the vowel replaces 0% or other vowels in '
the singular, and it tends to occur between
the penultimate and the last consonant of
the root, as with the Hebrew sagolates
*&#42;malk/&#42;malak-&#299;m* "king/s." In Akkadian such,
*a* is found in the reduplication plurals
*alak-tu/alkak-&#257;tu* "way/s," *&#353;am-u/&#353;amam-&#363;*
"sky/s," *m-&#363;/ m&#257;m-&#363;* "water/s"; such reduplications are common in Cushitic e. g. Somali
*dab/dabab???b* "fire/s."
