In this brief yet stimulating article, Lambert investigates the relationship of myth and ritual in ancient Mesopotamia, by discussing several case-studies and contextualizing them in their ancient religious and social contexts.

Lambert begins with an analysis of literary texts, namely *Atrahasis* and *Enuma Elish* - questioning the existence of aetiologies for ritual practices, and asking whether these epics (the *Enuma Elish* in particular) had been written for cultic use. To this last question, he gives a negative answer: <<**there is clearly a myth presupposed in the rites of the Akitu house**, a public ritual of Babylon. But **the written form of the myth known to us does not seem to have been written for recitation in a ritual at all**. This use seems to be secondary, and many have taken place once every month>>.

Lambert then goes on investigating incantations (<<it must be observed that only a small minority of incantations contain myths, so that there was nothing special, on the magic level, in a myth>>) and texts bearing ritual instructions and commentaries (highlighting the importance of the identifications, described in these texts, between the mythical events and the acts which were performed in rituals). He infers, then, that <<**the Babylonian school of Myth and Ritual was occupied in explaining traditional rituals as reenactments of traditional myths** ... **in all cases alike there is the fundamental presupposition that myths (...) were conceived to be recurring at regular intervals in the world in which the Babylonian authors lived**>>.
