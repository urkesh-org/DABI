After a critical review of earlier literature, especially Bauer, in which the general failure to extend 
the analysis outside of Semitic is emphasized, the main facts of the Hamitic verbal system are 
summarized: a is used for immediate present, i for pronmity, u for distance, all of them derived from 
local categories. Two main points are then stressed: (1) The purpose of the vowel was not to differentiate 
tenses, but rather fiens (u, with variant i) from factum (a). Both categories had originally 
prefix and suffix conjugation, of which eventually the first became strandardized for action, the second 
for state. (2) Psychological categories help to explain the change in position of the afformatives. (See 
also *ZDMG* 83, 1929, 90-1.)
