TO divine wrath

[Author's summary] The concept of divine wrath is important in the Hebrew Bible not only in explaining the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile at the hands of the Babylonians, but also in interpreting the reconstruction of the temple and the city during the early Persian period from a theological perspective. This essay investigates the role of Yhwh's anger in Zech 1-8, where it is given a special emphasis in the context of the reconstruction. Two conceptions of **divine wrath** are highlighted within this composition, which, it is argued, result from a complex literary growth involving a process of successive reinterpretations. The central section (Zech 1:7-6:15), recounting Zechariah's visions, depicts the wrath of **Yhwh against Jerusalem and Judah as temporary and limited in intensity**, in contrast to his overwhelming anger against the foreign nations; this conception serves to stress that Yhwh has not reneged on his choice of Jerusalem as his cultic place. It is best understood as legitimating the reconstruction of the second temple in the early Persian period and promoting its cult. By contrast, the oracles in Zech 1:1-6; 7-8 that frame the visions present **Yhwh's anger against his people as strong and also unstable, in that it can be triggered at any time if the Judeans behave wrongly**. This conception of divine wrath served to promote social justice within Judea and to enhance the authority of prophetic texts. It is best read as a later explanation of why the promises of restoration of Jerusalem and Judah were not fulfilled; moreover, the emphasis on social justice in these oracles points to a social setting among a scribal group that was involved in the regulation of socio-economical relations within the province.
