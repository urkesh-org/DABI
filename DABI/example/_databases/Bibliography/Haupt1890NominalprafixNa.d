Criticizes points of detail in Barth 1887 "Nominalpr&auml;fix na" showing especially that nouns like *n&#275;beru* are also of pattern *mapras*, not *mapris*, and also adding other examples of the assimilation *ma-* > *na-*. The article ends with the criticism of another article by Barth concerning verbs final weak.
