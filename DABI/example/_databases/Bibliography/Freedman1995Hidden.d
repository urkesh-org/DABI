TO disappearance of God; death of God; presence

The first part describes the "**disappearance of God**" in the Bible. That is to say, the progressive diminishment of public manifestations: the emblematic contrast is between Exodus on one hand (from the miracles in Egypt up to the conquest) and the reconstruction with Esdra on the other (where the emphasis is exclusively on the institutional ordering of the temple.)

The second part deals with the concept of the "**death of God**" as it was elaborated especially by Nietzsche, in contrast with a surprisingly similar theme in Dostoyevsky. "Death" as such is referred to "a situation which existed and which is finished" and in this sense does not coincide perfectly with the notion implicit in the title of the book, which is the disappearance or the self-hiding of God. What changes is in fact "the perception of the presence of God by humans" (p. 208).
