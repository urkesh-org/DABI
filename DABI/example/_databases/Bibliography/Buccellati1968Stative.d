The "stative" is not a tense of the verb, but rather a nominal sentence with predicate in the
predicative state and the subject as a pronominal suffix in the nominative. Arguments: (1) since the stative
occurs with all nouns, it would have to be considered a denominative tense (tenses proper cannot
be derived from nouns); (2) the stative does not take the modal (i.e., verbal) endings of the ventive
in cases where it would be phonologically possible; (3) the stative occurs regularly whenever the predicate
of a nominal sentence is not followed by a qualification or complement. The last point is based on
the observation that no nominal sentence of the type ana&ku Sarrum "I am (the) king" occurs in Akkadian
proper: sarr-a&ku or ana&ku &#353;arrum-ma must be used instead. The predicate occurs in the
normal or construct state when followed by a qualification or complement: ana&ku &#353;arrum damqum
"I am a good king" or atta sarr-i& "you are my king." Thus an analysis of the stative belongs to syntax,
since &#353;arr-a&ku and ana&ku &#353;arrum damqum are strictly equivalent, i.e., they are both nominal 
sentences. Also, &#353;arr-a&ku must be correlated in function to the West Semitic nominal sentence 
(&ano&ki* melek), not the West Semitic perfect (ma&lakti).
