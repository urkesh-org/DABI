TO Cuneiform texts from Assur

<<The entire inventory of the cuneiform texts of literary content from Assur to be published is expected to be presented in 20 volumes, which form the monograph series ‘KAL’ (‘Keilschrifttexte aus Assur literarischen Inhalts’). On the one hand, it consists of texts that are clearly legible and can be assigned to specific text groups or ‘text types’ with defined content, on the other hand it contains highly fragmented texts that are nevertheless of great importance for further text reconstruction. It therefore seemed sensible to arrange the series in such a way that the texts that can be assigned to the text groups defined in terms of content are presented in one part of its volumes, and the less well-preserved text fragments in a second, smaller part of the volumes>> (from website; English translation from German by mDP).

The website basically allows the download of many volumes, see specifically [here](https://digi.hadw-bw.de/view/kal), publishing cuneiform texts from Assur.
