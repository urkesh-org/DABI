Few texts have shaped more lastingly our understanding of the essence of urbanity and the social consequences of urbanization than Georg Simmel's essay on "The Metropolis and Mental Life", published first a hundred years ago. The subject of this contribution is the impact of the Metropolis on Simmel's own mental life. The main focus is on the sociologist's relationship with his home city Berlin. The methodological principle of reading Simmel's city texts biographically is played out in four episodes: Berlin the workers city, Berlin amusement culture, Berlin as seen from Rome, and Berlin in World War I. The episodes are connected in that throughout his life Simmel seems to have developed a growing antipathy towards the circumstances of urban life forms. The range of resentments goes from disgust with the sordid manifestations of urban plight to hate towards the self-indulgence of the rich. What remains open is why Simmel to this day is seen as urbanist (and modernist) par excellence, although he has left an oeuvre in which anti-urban (and anti-modern) affects can hardly go unrecognized.
