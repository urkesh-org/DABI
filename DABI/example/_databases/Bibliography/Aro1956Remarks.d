This article offers a list and an analysis of orthographic and phonetic differences between the Accadian found in the Alalakh texts and standard Accadian, with reference to Middle Babylonian and Nuzi dialects. Differences are categorized by noun, pronoun, verb, and by preposition, adverb, conjuction. Basically, the author has found that the language can be design- as Mitanni Accadian. It is similar to the Nuzi dialect in the confusion of voiced, voiceless, and emphatic stops; non-assimilation of *s* suffixes; occasional confusion of silibants; the writing of *-&#353;unu* for *-&#353;unuti*; confusion of pronoun gender; blunders in verb inflexion; the general use of the *-me* suffix; and general lack of knowledge in the area of syntax. The Alalakh grammar is generally more archaic than Nuzi and has been subjected to more West Semitic influence. However, it is identical to Old Babylonian in its use of mimation, frequent preservation of waw, the writings *u-ul*,*i-il-la-ak*, and the non contraction of-*i-a*. Mitanni Accadian shows more parallels with Middle Babylonian in the use of *m* for *w*; *a* becoming *e* in closed syllables; *st* becoming 16; loss of difference between accusative/dative; and in the use of *ina muhhi* instead of *eli*.
