Tsevat's article contains two parts, the first is a list of comments on the language of the Statue of Idrimi and the Alalakh texts which differ from those of the original translators, Smith and Wiseman. Part II was written primarily for the biblical scholar and contains observations made in comparing the Accadian of Alalakh to Canaanite and Hebrew. In this area, the author has found that outside of lists and stereotyped texts, Alalakh scribes display a good knowledge of Accadian. Tesvat cites that in addition to Canaanite influence, there exists a detectable Hurrian background. Finally, he notes that these texts do not contain Canaanite glosses.
