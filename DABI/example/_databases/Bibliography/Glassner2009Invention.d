TO incineration; offerings

This paper begins by questioning the assumption that the ancient Mesopotamian society made no distinction between an offering, a libation, or a sacrifice - an assumption that arose in the Assyriological discipline from the fact that one same word could designate either of these acts. Indeed, Glassner begins his text with an accurate analysis of the lexicon which was used in ancient Akkadian texts to describe actions connected to offerings and sacrifices.

Glassner intends "sacrifice" as a ritual oblation to invisible forces, characterized by the voluntary abandonment, sometimes destruction, of the offered thing. The bloody sacrifice is only one particular case, but the main focus of such act is the idea of renunciation that is at the center of the procedure. He also notes that, since the same words for "to slaughter" or "to kill" are used in different contexts (whatever the purpose of the act), the priest's gesture was distinguishable from that of the butcher only by the pronunciation of different words.

Glassner analyzes every aspect of the Mesopotamian sacrifice: at first, its aetiology (by taking into consideration Sumerian and Akkadian literaty texts) - then its practical features, with a particular focus on the daily meals offered to the gods in the Temple of Anu at Uruk during the Seleucid times. The scholar also discusses the ingredients that were brought to the divine tables, as well as every aspect of the divinatory sacrifice (preparatory phases, the oracular consultation, and conclusive moments of the ceremony).
