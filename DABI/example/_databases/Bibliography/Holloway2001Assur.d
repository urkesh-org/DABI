<<Steven Holloway’s work is the first monograph devoted to **Neo-Assyrian religious imperialism**. Neo Assyrian religious imperialism was expressed by punitive measures such as “godnapping”, the violent deportation of a vanquished foe’s divine images, but also, and this is a far less-studied facet of this topic, by the geographical focus and extent of the material support the Assyrians lavished on favored polities, in effect a Marshall Plan aimed at winning over the elite citizenry pivotal to maintaining economic and political equilibrium>> (abstract from publisher’s webpage).

[This publication focuses on the **role played by the figure of the god Assur in establishing a strong political power during the Neo-Assyrian period**. This effort undertaken by the Neo-Assyrian kings to qualify them as sovereign on behalf of the god’s will clearly exemplifies the relationships between political power and religion in the Neo-Assyrian kingdom; cf. also {B}R/Liverani2017Assyria.]
