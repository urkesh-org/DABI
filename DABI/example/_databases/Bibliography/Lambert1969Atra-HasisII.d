Defends his interpretation of locative *-&#363;m* as comparative because:
a late text writes *k&#299; am&#299;li* as a variant for *aw&#299;l&#363;m*; VON SODEN
1969 ("Atramhasis" I) is wrong lexically, grammatically and exegetically; in another text a form in *-i&#353;* (which can be comparative in
meaning) is given as variant for a form in *-&#363;m*.
