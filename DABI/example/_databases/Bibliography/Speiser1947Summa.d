The basic process to express a conditional sentence in Semitic "consists in giving the protasis as a direct statement"; protasis and apodesis may be connected asyndetically or with the ordinary conjunction for "and"; in addition the protasis may be marked by means of special particles which "can be promptly identified as ordinary demonstrative elements" (p. 460). Akkadian uses the same process, and *&#353;umma* is in reality a demonstrative element, formed of the demonstrative pronoun *&#353;u&#39;* and the enclitic *-ma*. The original meaning of this particle is "this is (so)," (though the best translation remains "if,") and hence the use of the indicative rather than the subjunctive.
