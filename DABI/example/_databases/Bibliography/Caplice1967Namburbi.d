TO namburbi (Akkadian); Appendix 13

This contribution publishes some Akkadian *namburbi* texts, specific rituals and incantations aiming at averting the action of malefic or evil entities. Some of these texts are mentioned by G. Buccellati in his book on Mesopotamian religion, specifically in [*Appendix 13*](http://4banks.net/Mes-rel/Excerpts/appendices_mDP.htm#13). The paper represents the continuation of {B}R/Caplice1965Namburbi. 

[The book is listed in this bibliography since it is used as the basic reference to [*namburbi*](http://publikationen.badw.de/de/rla/index#8207) texts in G. Buccellati’s volume.]
