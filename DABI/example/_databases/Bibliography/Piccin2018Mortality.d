TO death; mortality; fame; taboo; afterlife; destiny

<<Not all topics can be treated in the same way. Some are too intimate or thorny to be discussed without precautions in our use of language. One of these topics is undoubtedly **death**, a timeless and placeless **taboo** in which psychological, religious, and social interdictions are embodied. The aim of this paper is to explore the linguistic devices that Akkadian speakers used to tone down the taboo and cope with death. To address the issue, written sources, belonging to different genres and time periods, are examined>> (Author’s abstract on p. 137).

After the *introduction*, devoted to the definition of the topic, i.e. ‘death’, described as <<mankind’s unavoidable destiny>> (p. 1), the author moves (*paragraph 1*) to the topic of the **afterlife** as conceived in Mesopotamia, through the analysis (conducted also under an anthropological perspective) of the terminology used to speak about death, a realm where some words are treated as **taboos** (defined also as **euphemisms**), in a process of <<**linguistic interdiction**>> (p. 2). 

Despite the lack of a complete publication of all Akkadian sources, the author tries <<to begin bridging this gap by reflecting on the applicability of the concept of the ‘taboo’ to discourse within the Akkadian world>> (p. 2). This analysis starts in *paragraph 2* from a ‘problem of imagery’, trying to retrace some specific words in Akkadian sources attested as qualifier or specifications of the concept of death, describing an imagery-lexicon: <<hand of death>> (*qāti mūtim*) and <<mouth of death>> (*pī mūti*) (p. 3). Of course, a problem of interpretation occurs, since we are dealing with a ‘broken tradition’ (see G. Buccellati’s contribution in [CAR](https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm). *Paragraph 3* describes the so-called ‘Scurlock Hypothesis’, focusing on some locutions used in Akkadian to express the concept of ‘being dead’.

*Paragraph 4* analyses the actual Akkadian words for ‘death’ (*mūtu*) and for the verb ‘to die’ (*mâtu*) (p. 3), stressing how these terms are applied to a specific figurative realm, involving the concepts of <<‘otherworldly’ trip>> or more abstract expressions, such as <<to be invited by gods>> (*qerûm*) or <<to sleep>> (p. 3; cf. p. 7); these concepts involve a trip described through a particular vocabulary including the Akkadian words for ‘road’ (*harrānum*, *urhum*) (p. 4), for ‘mountain’ (*šadû*) (p. 7), and for ‘destiny’ (*šīmtu*), in the expression <<to go to one’s destiny>> (p. 8). The concept of ‘sleeping’ applied to death is investigated in *sub-paragraph 4.2.3*, with reference to the [***Epic of Gilgamesh***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh) (p. 9). Indeed, the two topics of ‘fame’ and ‘death’ are well-developed and investigated in the [***Epic of Gilgamesh***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh), where the hero is perceived as a ‘Suchende’ (according to a definition by Hermann Hesse) of the fame (through his deeds), firstly, and of the immortality (through the quest for the plant of the endless-life) (cf. [Mora, Giorgieri 2016](http://urkesh.org/abstracts/923MoraGiorgieri2016.htm), directly quoting [Buccellati, G. 1972](http://urkesh.org/attach/BuccellatiG1972a.pdf), p. 34). 

*Paragraphs 5-8* (pp. 9-14) deeply analyse the concept of death contrasting the aforementioned ‘Scurlock Hypothesis’, while *paragraphs 9-10* deal with suicide and taboo, respectively (p. 15).
   
The author concludes: <<In light of the entire discussion, it is clear that death exerted a powerful influence on the imagination of Akkadian users, which in turn deeply influenced their linguistic behaviour>> (p. 16).

[The precise definition of specific concepts related to Mesopotamian religious thought is sometimes difficult to be established, because of the lack or at least the obscurity of determined terms clearly translatable and fully understandable by a modern reader avoiding any modern superimposition. The value of this contribution consists in the strictly philological analysis of terms or phrasal expressions used to define ‘death’ and other concepts related to that, like ‘mortality’, ‘fate’/’destiny’, ‘afterlife’, and ‘taboo’.]

TO šīmtu

Although an evident difficulty in defining ancient concepts with modern terms, we can be fairly sure that the ancient Akkadian term *šīmtu* (mentioned by G. Buccellati in this section) corresponds to our idea of ‘fate’ or ‘destiny’. On this topic, see e.g. {B}R/Piccin2018Mortality, *Paragraph 4*.

TO death; afterlife

The definition of ‘death’ and ‘afterlife’ in ancient Mesopotamian is easily understood, since it is hard to find specific terms referring to these aspects or it is even difficult to interpret those terms because we are dealing with a [*broken tradition*](https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm). A strictly philological analysis on this topic is offered in {B}R/Piccin2018Mortality, where the author faces the problem of interpretation of terms or expressions referring to concepts like ‘mortality’, ‘fate’/’destiny’, ‘afterlife’, and ‘taboo’.
