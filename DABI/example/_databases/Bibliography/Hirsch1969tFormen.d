Presupposing the internal unity of the main Akkadian legal work (esp. Eshnunna and Hammurapi), studies with some statistical computation the function of present, preterit and especially the perfect in the *&#353;umma*-clauses. The present does not express potential or volitive condition except perhaps occasionally; it serves simply to express a durative-present or an extratemporal condition (alternating sometimes with the stative on the basis of lexical criteria), it has, in other words, no special meaning simply because it appears in a *&#353;umma*-clause. Similar considerations apply to the preterite: this also has no speÓÅècial meaning in a *&#353;umma*-clause, but refers simply to the completed past (this particularly against conceptions attributing a present value to the pret. in the codes). Temporal succession, i.e. relative posteriority of one action with respect to another, is often expressed by a sequence of two preterites. "Perfect" forms may in fact be explained in many cases as t-stem preterites with passive value (and inverted subject), which may well have been the primary function of the t-form (p. 130); this then progressed slowly to an active value with various functions: instrumental, causal, adversative (126 f.), sometimes also temporal (129), but without any specialization of the form to express posteriority in the past (as normally assumed); at most, from a temporal-aspectual point of view, the perfect may be conceived as a "punctual present" (Landsberger), mitigating the transition from preterite of protasis to present of apodosis: "If an ox has gored a man and will have killed him..." (130).
