This article examines the problems raised by traditional definitions of magic and divination and re-evaluates the ways in which the Western world has viewed 'magic' as part of a series of dichotomies: religion vs. magic, science vs. magic. The author shows a particular attention towards ancient and modern terminology: for example, she highlights that the very term 'magic' is derived from the classical world and mostly expresses a Hellenic worldview. She suggests, instead, to look at the original and specific terms used to refer to magic and divination so as to gain an insight into their specific sociological and historical context.

According to Jeffrey, to study magic and divination implies to witness the history of a paradigm shift. These categories, instead of being considered within their own original context, have often been taken on the worldview of the Western world: she argues that the Greeks of the classical period might be held responsible for having introduced a polemic against magic. Religion and magic must instead be considered as part of a wider system of intermediation and interconnection between the spheres of nature, human, animal, vegetal and mineral. Indeed, Jeffrey states that, in the ancient Near East, magic and religion were part of the cosmic order of the world. As a result, <<In the ancient Near East, the term 'magic' has little value from an 'etic' perspective, and a better definition can only be an 'emic' one, as 'intermediation' practices that relate to the wider cosmological worldview of the ancient Near East.>> (p. 689)
