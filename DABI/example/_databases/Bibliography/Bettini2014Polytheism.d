TO polytheism; peace; conflict

<<If one starts from the principle that the gods are many, the motivations for affirming that the gods of others are false gods or demons is removed. Within our societies, adopting the mental schemes proper to polytheism would certainly reduce the levels of conflict between the different monotheistic religions and their internal subdivisions.>> 2000 years of monotheism have made us used to think that God cannot be but one, exclusive, true. On the contrary, ancient polytheism foresaw the possibility of making the gods of different cultures correspond to each other (the Greek Artemis to the Roman Diana, the Egyptian Isis to the Greek Athena), and thus welcome foreign gods into its own pantheon. This open position meant that the ancient world did not see the religious violence that has bloodied, and still bloodies, monotheistic cultures. Is it possible to draw on the resources of polytheism today in order to render easier and more serene the relationships between various religions? [Editor's summary]

TO polytheism; violence

A common idea (for instance in ({B}R/Bettini2014Polytheism) holds that polytheism is more tolerant and less violent than monotheism. However, the two different religious views cannot be compared "straight across" and used for their civil effects. They differ at the level of grammatical structure, as it were, between transitive and intransitive verbs. â€“ [March 2020]
