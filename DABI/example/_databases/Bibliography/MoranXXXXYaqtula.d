Focusing upon the 66 EA letters from Byblos, Moran argues that there existed in early NW Semitic a subjunctive in -a, *yaqtula*, with definite syntactic functions forming principally two patterns: a) wish, request,command in independent clauses; b)independent clauses of purpose or intended result. The arguments against seeing the ventive (formally identical), but rather this functionally separate feature,are: 1)examples differing only in *yaqtulu* / *yaqtula*, with a clear difference of indicative /'volitive', while *no* criteria can be set up for use/non-use of ventive; the ventive does not occur in many cases where we might expect it; 2) use of *yaqtulu* in EA agrees with Arabic sche,e of *qatala*/ *yaqtulu* / *yaqtul*; 3) there is definite modal congruence in purpose clauses: if 1st clauses is imper., juss., or *yaqtula*, then purpose clauses is jussive or *yaqtula*, showing that *yaqtula*, like the jussive, is a volitive. (A) and (B) agree with Heb.use of the cohortative; (B) agrees with Arabic jussive, although only scant traces of (A) can be seen in Arabic. Moran follows with a breakdown of twenty-five other cases, which do not fit (A)or (B), but which in general tentatively agree with Arabic/Hebrew. A problem is the distinction between function of jussive and subjunctive in EA: there was apparently little or none; possible this feature had already broken down by the 14th century, but the evidence does not permit a final decision.
