TO dedication inscriptions; Nippur

In this paper the author displays some texts regarding **dedication inscription** from [Nippur](https://nippur-digitized.com/), specifically focusing on those inscriptions related to the goddess [Inanna](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/inanaitar/index.html).  

[The contribution is helpful in supporting the argumentation of G. Buccellati about the function of dedication inscriptions to Inanna.]
