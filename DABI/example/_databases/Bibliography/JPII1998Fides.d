TO faith and reason

<<Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth -- in a word, to know himself -- so that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves>> (p. 1).

[This encyclical letter specifically deals with the **relationship between faith and reason**, described both as two ways to reach the truth; even different in their peculiar *raison d’être* (faith being based on revelation while reason on the scientifical method), they both contribute to the admonition γνῶθι σεαυτόν/*nosce te ipsum*, discussed in the introduction of the encyclical letter as the common purpose of both faith and reason.]
