TO polytheism; henotheism

Whatham's study, written over 100 years ago, asserts that "**the Israelites, when taken in hand by Moses, were polytheists**, a belief, moreover, which was only finally eradicated through the teaching of the prophets, and the bitter experience of the captivity." 

He examines a few scriptural passages that point to **a form of polytheism or tribal henotheism at the origins of Israel**, such as God's self-revelation to Moses in Ex 6:3, Jacob's treatment of his wives' gods in Gen 35:4, and the fact that Moses commands the people to worship YHWH because he is a "jealous god"--not because he is the only god. It was the prophets who radicalized henotheism into exclusive monotheism, in Whatham's estimation. 

Whatham notes some inconsistencies regarding the forbidding of images, especially the episode regarding the bronze serpent in Num 21, and concludes that Moses' command regarded only images of foreign gods. Thus, "Israel did not conceive Jehovah to be the sole God; in fact, as I have shown, they viewed him merely as one among other gods, though as a rule the greatest of all gods. Indeed, until the advent of the later prophets, Israel's teachers had so instructed them."
