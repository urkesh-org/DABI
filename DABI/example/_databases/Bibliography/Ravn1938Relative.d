Anticipating the fuller exposition of 1941 it stresses the identity in function between the determinative and the relative pronoun *&#353;a*; this is a representative and generalizing pronominal particle ("pronominal" in the precise sense that it can only resume a noun or nouns, not a sentence). There is no difference between the phrase/ clause with and the one without the particle.
