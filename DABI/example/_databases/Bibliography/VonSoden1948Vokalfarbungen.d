The four main vocalic phonemes of Akkadian are occasionally realized with phonetic variations which are indicated by the writing in the following manner: phonetic *o* written either *a-u* (e.g. *ka-uk-ki*), or with *a* in place of *u* and viceversa (*i-ta-ar-ru* instead of *i-tu-ur-ru*); phonetic *&uuml;* written *u-i*, *i-u*, or with *i* in place of *u*; phonetic *&ouml;* written *e-u*, and possibly phonetic *&euml;* written *a-i*, *i-a*. The majority of the examples is taken from letters, thus beieng possibly an index of vulgar speech, but in any case they are simple phonetic variations, with no morphological consequences. The device of broken writing is especially frequent in OB, that of substition in NA.
