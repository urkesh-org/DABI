A morphological and syntactical analysis of the individual Semitic languages (with emphasis on Northwest-Semitic) followed by a brief comparative section in the conclusions. For Akkadian, Von Sodenâ€™s presentation of 1952 is followed very closely, one difference being the interpretation of final *-i* (noted by E. Reiner in the kudurru's) as a dative-adverbial ending (pp. 170, 176-77, 185).
