The article is really about the permansive (=stative), to the study of which it contributes important insights. The permansive "describes the process of an action as concluded or as extent in its completeness" (p. 277). Of itself, the permansive is neither active nor passive: *&#231;abt&#257;ku* means "I am one in whom the action of seizing has come to completion", while *eqlam &#231;abt&#257;ku* means "I am one, in whom the action of seizing the field has come to completion" (p. 278). Without an object, it is normally passive, whereas the presence of the object makes it active (p. 281). The permansive is to be interpreted as the Participium perfecti (= verbal adjective) in the status indeterminatus (= predicative state), and one should not distinguish between the verbal adjectives and the stative, as is traditionally done (p. 278). The permansive is not defined temporally, and may also be used for the future (p. 281, n. 1, with several examples, in contrast with              . In many cases, the situation described by the stative may best be translated by using the verb "to have", e.g. *m&#257;r&#299; wald&#257;ku* "I have children" (pp. 279-80).
