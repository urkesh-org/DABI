A coincidental (KOSCHMIEDER), or perhaps better a performative (BENVENISTE) verb is one which serves to express identity of speaking and action, as in *u&#353;ka''in ana &#355;uppirc &#353;a &#257;lim* "I bow to the tablet(-ordinance) of the city":  here action and statement of the action are contemporary (and performed by the same subject). In Akkadian (as in Hebrew and Arabic, 152) the past tense is used, i.e. the preterite, as in the example just quoted; in such cases then a correct translation must be in the present. The perfect may at first seem to serve the same purpose, but actually that is not the case: thus, in the letters, *a&#353;tapram* refers to an action which is completed with the sending of the letter.
