After a short review of the history of the
problem and of the source material, noting,
especially the frequent occurrence of t-forms
with certain verbs, the main function of the
T stem is analyred as one of subjective intensification of the verbal concept, as distinct
from the absolute, objective intensification of
of tho D stem (Par. III.I). In addition, a
perfective function is also noted (III.III),
while a passive and reflexive function is
considered very rare (III.VI). Final remarks
with dialectal and historical considerations
(the introduction of t-forms being attributed
to Amorites, V.III).
