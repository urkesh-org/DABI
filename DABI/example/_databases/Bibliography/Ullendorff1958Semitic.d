Poses the problem of identity of a Semitic language: we recognize it as such when we meet one, but how can this be articulated in rigorous, descriptive-typological (and not genealogical-historical) terms? First U. criticizes some standard criteria as insufficient: role and function of the consonants, internal vocalic changes, triliterality, phonological traits such as &#39; or &#7717;, syntactic traits such as parataxis or word order. Then he gives as positive suggestions the need of Hamito-Semitic comparisons, structural, lexical, statistical and isogloss studies, and the definition of thought categories as conditioned by linguistic factors.
