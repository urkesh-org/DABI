This article stems from a preliminary preassumption: <<kingship in Mesopotamia was always sacred, but only rarely divine>> (p. 261). Cooper, then, tries to find answers to three research questions: what impelled some Mesopotamian kings of the third millennium BCE (Naram-Sin and Shulgi in particular) to break with the traditional model of kingship and become gods? How did divine kingship differ from traditional kingship? And why was divine kingship in Mesopotamia a fleeting phenomenon?

While discussing these issues, Cooper provides a review of the existing bibliography for this topic, taking into consideration both epigraphical and archaeological evidence. From his investigation of primary sources, Cooper comes to several conclusions: firstly, that the deification of a ruler was mostly purely ideological, and that it changed the practice of kingship little - if at all. A strong rule gained no additional power from his godship, nor was a weak ruler protected by it. Cooper also infers that a divinized king was no god but partook of the divine, and he remained human - but without many of the limitations typical of a human being.

He concludes that <<since divine kingship cross-culturally seemes to be the exception rather than the rule, ther could well be some basic human cognitive resistance to pushing any living mortal fully into the category of the divine>> (p. 264).
