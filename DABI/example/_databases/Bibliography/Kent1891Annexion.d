With statistical computations based on Assyrian royal inscriptions comes to the following conclusions. The last vowel of a construct is not used capriciously, but according to certain rules: *i* is used with roots third weak, to resolve final cluster of long consonant, for the sake of euphony when the preceding vowel is also *i*, and when the noun in the construct is in the genitive case; *u* is used with roots third weak, for the sake of euphony after *u*, and when the construct is in the nominative; *a* and mimation practically neÓÅèver occur; dropping of final vowel is regular after short consonant, even when the construct noun is in the genitive. [The continuation of the article, promised at the end, never appeared].
