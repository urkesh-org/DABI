Cohen traces the evolution of the attitude towards **divine retribution** through its inception during the Sumerian civilization to its culmination amid the post-Kassite period, citing an increasing nihilism reflective of extensive socio-economic inequality. Through close readings and subsequent critiques of interpretations by four scholars, as well as an investigation into the socio-political climate of the Kassite/Post-Kassite period, **Cohen wishes to debunk the notion that historical circumstances were the underlying impetus in the development of wisdom literature**.

<small>Thorkild Jacobsen likens the intellectual development of questioning the nature of the divine to the evolution of a child into adulthood. He suggests that at the earliest stage, man's relationship with the divine is like that of a child who sees its parents without flaw. Upon maturity, it realizes a growing deception, or more so, inability, for the gods to reign righteously - considering the unjust nature of society and retribution. Jacobsen rationalizes this development from an evolutionary perspective, a combination of the transition from communal to individual worship and historical realities. The despair inherent to wisdom texts is reflective of the Assyrian domination of the Near East, which saw an increasingly lawless, less civilized society. 

W.G. Lambert cites the arrival and socialization of the Amorites as a factor in the emergent theology of the problem of theodicy. The rising intellectual nihilism reflected in literature during the Kassite period was circumstantial to the failing conditions of Babylon under Kassite rule. 

Whether social conditions were reflected in religious doctrine was the concern of Rainer Albertz, who conflates ideology in the Book of Job with the Babylonian Theodicy. Transformations in religious ideology were congruous to a Post-Kassite weakening state during the Second Dynasty of Isin, which experienced many invasions and increasing economic instability. Albertz reconciled the newfound wealth of a rising neo-nobility with an increase in doubt towards the validity of the gods divine order, in his view most apparent in the Babylonian Theodicy. 

Karel van der Toorn detects a shift in the psyche of Babylonia which manifested after the emergence of the "nouveau riche". This new class of nobility caused a social rift which saw concepts of divine justice transform into the dualism of wicked and righteous. This social transformation birthed the nihilism apparent in the Babylonian Theodicy. However, van der Toorn also postulates the genesis of a "counter-dogma" evident in texts such as *Enmeduranki*. He suggests that this was a last-ditch attempt to aggrandize Mesopotamian wisdom, endowing it with ancient roots to increase its validity. </small>

Cohen rebukes the evolutionary model of the development of social thought as reactionary, which he suggests is convenient and dismissive of complex phenomena. He broadens the definition of theodicy to include the sufferer's point of view as relevant and non-consequential. Historical and textual evidence is found to be insufficient for the supposition that social conditions influenced nihilistic attitudes. Cohen illustrates that **Mesopotamian wisdom literature had a long-standing history of questioning the nature of the divine**, suggesting the tradition to be inherent of Mesopotamian culture. The problem of Theodicy is far more complex than previous scholarship inferred and cannot be reduced to the response of a particular historical event or the fruit of social evolution.

The economic status and abandonment of urban centers during the First Dynasty of Babylon was not reflective of a failing state. Cohen suggests that due to a lack of textual evidence from the Kassite period, socio-political commentary is premature and speculative. Similarly, Post-Kassite Babylonia, although stricken with many afflictions, was not as disastrous as previous scholarship inferred. The negative outlook towards this period developed as a result of the emergence of a neo-nobility, explicitly mentioned in the Babylonian Theodicy, which gained wealth from land/entitlement grants and tax exemption. However, Brinkman warns that the inference of a weak state during the Kassite period, citing kudurrus as a source of information, is faulty and inconsistent with other known sources. Cohen argues the documentary evidence is insufficient to conclude that Babylonian society was in a state of despair following the collapse of the First Dynasty of Babylon through the Post-Kassite period, and thus the literature produced in that time-frame is not reflective of social transformations or theological reactions. 

The questioning of philosophical tradition, divine retribution and nihilistic attitudes towards general social conditions has a long-standing history in Mesopotamia, in both Sumerian and Akkadian texts. This genre of literature co-existed with religious texts that expressed exaltation towards the gods and state. Cohen goes on to cite examples from Sumerian and Akkadian texts that exemplify the longevity of a philosophical tradition of examining the nature of divine retribution. He finds that **what is perceived as nihilism by modern scholarship is actually an understanding by the ancient authors that the gods may have never been concerned with the behavior of people**; they are exclusively driven by the promise of offerings. Thus the relationship one has with the divine is one of mutual concession. Even then, the fate of humanity is unpredictable, as is expressed in literature where a sufferer is plagued by misfortune despite being well-versed in the necessary rituals to expel it. The inferred nihilism is reflective of the inability to understand the actions of the gods. Cohen notes the scribal traditions of later periods were endowed with a rich corpus of ideas to build upon, and developed the critique of divine retribution as well as the condition of the sufferer more finely over time, thus concluding his argument.

A succinct overview of the perception of wisdom literature from past scholars. Cohen offers new insight into Mesopotamian literary tropes and their historical influences.
