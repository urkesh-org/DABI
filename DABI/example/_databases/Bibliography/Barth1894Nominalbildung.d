Still the classical work about nominal formation, first published in 1889. Besides the bery considerable amount of material collected (including Akkadian, for which the proofs of Delitzsche's grammar were used), the book is notable for its theoretical approach, whose two ground rules are: (1) derivation of all nominal forms (excepting those which we now call "primary nouns," see pp. 1-9), from either the "perfect" or the "imperfect" of the verb, where one should note that the introduction of the imperfect-c;ass is one of Barth's innovations; (2) systematic correlations among all main types of Semitic languages, with rigorous application of phonological rules.
