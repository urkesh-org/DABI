<<This book presents an interdisciplinary study of the role of **spirituality** and **religious ritual** in the emergence of complex societies. Involving an eminent group of natural scientists, archaeologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and theologians, this volume examines **Çatalhöyük** as a case study. A nine-thousand-year old town in central Turkey, Çatalhöyük was first excavated in the 1960s and has since become integral to understanding the symbolic and ritual worlds of the early farmers and village-dwellers in the Middle East. It is thus an ideal location for exploring theories about the role of religion in early settled life. This book provides a unique overview of current debates concerning religion and its historical variations. Through exploration of themes including the integration of the spiritual and the material, the role of belief in religion, the cognitive bases for religion, and religion's social roles, this book situates the results from Çatalhöyük within a broader understanding of the Neolithic in the Middle East>> (description on [editor’s webpage](www.cambridge.org/9780521150194)).

The complex and ancient site of [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), in Konya Plain (Anatolia), is here presented by [Ian Hodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Hodder) (the director of the excavations) as a study case in the emergence and development of the concept of **religion** in ancient Turkey and generally in ancient Near East, at the dawn of the Neolithic Period. 

Hodder starts by presenting a basic **methodological question**: how to prove the presence of a religious thoughts in a so ancient site? The answer involves an interdisciplinary approach, a project which is wholly presented in this first chapter, discussing about the history and background of the project, asking how to approach the topic under an archaeological perspective, able to detect (or to decode) the traces of ancient spiritual thought and transcendentality in so ancient times, wandering how **violence** and **death** could contribute in the emergence of religiosity.

Later chapters deal with the **symbolism** of Çatalhöyük in its regional context, <<to situate the symbolism and ritual at Çatalhöyük in the wider context of eastern Turkey and the Middle East>> (p. 32), offering parallelisms with other Anatolian and Near Easter ancient sites.

Hodder concludes with some basic questions: a) <<How can archaeologists recognize the spiritual, religious and transcendent in early time periods>>?; b) <<Are changes in spiritual life and religious ritual a necessary prelude to the social and economic changes that lead to ‘civilization’>>?; c) <<Do human forms take on a central role in the spirit world in the early Holocene, and, if so, does this centrality lead to new conceptions of human agency that themselves provide the possibility for the domestication of plants and animals?>>; d) <<Do violence and death act as the loci of transcendent religious experience during the transitions of the early Holocene in the Middle East, and are such themes central to the creation of social life in the first large agglomerations of people?>>. The respective answers to such questions surely represent the most important goal and achievement of the entire volume.

[The contribution is relevant as an introduction to the first attested forms of religiosity and rituals in the ancient site of [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), in Anatolia.]

TO prehistory; emergence of religious thought

G. Buccellati discusses in this section the emergence of religious thoughts and cultic practices in prehistory, stressing how such an investigation is mainly based on archaeological evidence. For the emergence of religious thoughts and cultic practices in prehistorical Anatolia (one of the first specimens attested in archaeology), mostly at [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), see {B}R/Hodder2010Emergence (cf. *infra* also {B}R/Schmidt2011Costruirono, on the prehistorical site of [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe), in South-Eastern Anatolia).
