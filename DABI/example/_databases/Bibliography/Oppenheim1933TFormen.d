The t-forms in the Code are used especially at the end of meaning
units, and normally in the protasis instead of the apodosis: thus they
acquire the value of pausal forms and serve to express a special sentence stress (the use of *t* for emphatic purposes is favored in Akkadian by the abundance of weak roots and the introduction of *t* to 
restore triradicalism). Not rarely, t-forms are omitted in contexts identical to those *with* t-forms: the difference is explained by admitting
two different sources of the Code, a more recent one *with* t-forms
(A), and an earlier one *without* (B); the editor who put together the
two sources wrote himself in the style of B (p. 186 f.). Follows an
exegetical analysis of the laws divided in groups depending on meaning and source (187-208); the tabulation on pp. 213-17 assigns 170
laws to A and 85 to B. Historically, B is seen to represent the
earlier Sumero-Akkadian tradition, A instead a more recent Semitic 
tradition to be localized in the South; only the topics on which the
sources showed contrasting legislation came to be represented in the
Code (218-20).
