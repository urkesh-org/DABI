An analysis of verbs of the type labisa/yalbasu, for which the Akkadian equivalents are given
as roots with root vowel a (sabit/isbat). They are considered as internal deponents, or as "adherent"
verbs, in that they place an emphasis on the effect of the process on the agent (thus e.g. for Arabic
&#353;ariba "to drink" the process is seen from the viewpoint of the stomach, rather than of the drink).
