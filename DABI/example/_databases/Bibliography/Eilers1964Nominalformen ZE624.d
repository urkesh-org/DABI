Here goes the **summary**. Only Formal criteria have been used so far for the arrangement of patterns. This article is meant to emphasize the semasiological evolution in order to bring out more clearly the fundamental meaning of the patterns. Two main types of evolution are observed. (1) use of substantives as adjectives (e. g. rugum &#363; "distance - far") caused by ellipsis, predicative and adverbial use of the substantive apposition. (2) Use of noun of object for persons, i. e. personification (e. g. nurbum "proximity &#363; near relative; see esc. np. 126-33 for Akkadian).
