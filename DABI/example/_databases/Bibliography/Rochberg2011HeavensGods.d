Rochberg's main research question is whether there has ever been an idea of a divine unity, a "monotheism", within the ancient Mesopotamian view of the relation between the divine and heaven. Ultimately, Rochberg gives a negative answer to such question. She states that the fact that cuneiform texts never address this topic confirms that the idea of a universal, divine "oneness" was not present in Mesopotamian theologies.

By analyzing a few Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian texts, however, she investigates the relation between the the gods and the stars, as the connection between the heavens and the divine was indeed present and continuous in the Mesopotamian religion. Though heaven was never considered as divine in itself, gods were indeed associated or even identified with heavenly bodies.

<<Polytheism itself forestalled a unified view of "cosmos", in favor of cosmic regions that were divinized and drafted into mythological stories.>> (p. 119) Rochberg also takes into consideration the Sumerian term &#352;&#193;R (present in several divine names, such as the divine pair AN.&#352;&#193;R  and KI.&#352;&#193;R), whose meaning "totality" (= Akkadian *ki&#353;&#353;atu*) she derives not from the idea of "oneness", but of "many" - and therefore connoted a unity comprised of plurality.

Then, she analyzes the cuneiform signs used to designate the term 'god' (i.e. the sign AN, consisting in the image of a eight-pointed star) as well as the term 'star' (the sign MUL, which was made of three AN-signs thus recalling a constellation). In Rochberg's view, there were two modes of referring to the divinity of the heavenly bodies in cuneiform sources: in the first one (which she labels "embodiment"), gods were referred to or spoken of as celestial bodies - conversely, in the second one (called "representation") celestial bodies were referred to as gods.

With regard to transcendence and immanence, Rochberg writes: <<**It may be tempting to appeal to notions of transcendence and immanence when trying to characterize the Babylonian theology, which gives rise to images of the divine and its relation to the universe. I think, however, that it is ultimately not very helpful**. Though the word *transcendence* can certainly have a nontheological usage - said of something that is above and beyond in excellence, even otherworldly - its usual connotations are religious, specifically Christian, and refer to the excellence and otherworldliness of God and the notion of God as being above and outside the universe, his creation. *Immanence*, on the other hand, can also pertain to things in general; etymologically, "being within" or not exceeding a given domain. But in a religious context, again mostly Christian, immanence connotes the existence or presence of God inside creation, within the world. **It would be misleading to import theological notions such as these into ancient Mesopotamia or somehow to shape the ideas contained in cuneiform texts into this mold**.>> (p. 133)
