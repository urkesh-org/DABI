I. "The 'Causative' conjugation" is to be explained essentially in terms of syntax, namely as an elliptical sentence, more properly a compound sentence: *u&#353;abn&#299;* means properly that a subject A has ordered or induced another subject B to build something, but the governing verb has dropped. The prefix *&#353;* is an original feminine personal pronoun, identical in function to the masc. pron, *h*, which is found as causative prefix in other Semitic languages.
II. "The So-Called Feminine Ending *-(a)t*" is to be connected with adverbial *-t(a)*, with *t* in *yati* (of Hamito-Semitic origin), with the nota accusativi *&#42;et* in Hebrew. Its original function was to provide derivative words with special modifications of original meaning of root, of which modifications the feminine was only a particular one.
