TO Experience; Distinctions

A distinction proposed by sociologist E. Zerubavel seems to reflect the differences Buccellati describes between polytheism and monotheism: <<The rigid mind typically envisions a highly compartmentalized world made up of sharply delineated insular entities separated from one another by great divides. The fuzzy mind, by contrast, invokes a world made up of vague essences fading gradually into one another. Instead of mental ghettos, it features mental twilight zones. Instead of clear-cut distinctions, it highlights ambiguities. Both mind-sets entail certain costs as well as certain advantages.>> (p. 115) 
In concluding his work, Zerubavel proposes a flexible merging of the two ‘kinds of mind’ he distinguishes: <<The world can be so much richer than the rigid mind with its either/or logic would allow us to realize. That, however, requires elastic boundaries that would not preclude multiple ways of carving up the world into ‘things.’ … Flexibility need not entail giving up structure altogether. It does imply, however, dynamic, elastic mental structures. Such structures would allow us to break away from the mental cages in which we so often lock ourselves, yet still avoid chaos. With them, we can be creative as well as secure.>> (p. 122).

Are Zerubavel’s two ‘kinds of minds’ an echo of the polytheism/monotheism distinction, or is that distinction their product?
