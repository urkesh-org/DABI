TO Monotheism; Polytheism; Covenant; Law

This insightful article distinguishes sharply between **Biblical monotheism** (particularly in its moral structure) and **Mesopotamian polytheism** (which Mendenhall likens to contemporary North American society, and liberalism in general).

The <<structures of control systems>> (political or social power) and values, while opposites, are not necessarily at war with each other. <<The clear message of the Bible is that social systems can continue to exist only where a minimally tolerable **value system** has already become operative>> (p. 171). Further, <<the mainstream of biblical faith is … the affirmation of a real factor in human life and experience that is independent of, not produced by, but ultimately essential to the existence and satisfactory operation of any social control system.>> (p. 171)

The second part of the article is an outline of what could be a <<monumental ten volume work>> if the author had the energy to complete it. He compares <<Covenant>> with <<Law>> along 10 different axes, and demonstrates the radical difference between the two. **Covenant**, in brief, creates *ex nihilo* a society oriented to the good; **law** presupposes a society and attempts to exclude the negative by enacting a war between society and the transgressor.

The competition between power structures is insoluble in their own terms alone. <<A sense of **justice and right … must take precedence over selfish interest**. The permanent symbol of the necessity as well as the reality of that Rule of God is the crucifixion of Jesus--the equally permanent affirmation that <<winning>> in the jungle of social manipulation and social competitiveness cannot be the controlling motivation of those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and peace.>> (p. 178).

TO morality; law; kingdom of God

The difference between a law-based morality and the relationship-based **morality** (which includes themes such as love, pardon, mercy, and the like) that Buccellati emphasizes in the biblical tradition clarifies Mendenhall’s distinction between values and “interests” (the latter being those motivating factors referred to under the titles of power, prestige, and wealth). Mendenhall clarifies that the **Kingdom of God** is “the leaven—the qualitative functioning—of a transcendent factor that the Bible calls God, which is radically other than social control systems, which society benefits from, but which it can neither produce nor control” (p. 177). Laws are still necessary, but they are “simply not the way the Rule of God operates”. (p. 177)

TO political structures; ecclesiastical structures; community

Mendenhall states that “To summarize the biblical concept of social control systems, any action induced by such systems that is based upon individual motivations of economic gain, prestige (publicity), or ambition for power has nothing to do with the Kingdom of God. … The problem in ancient as well as modern times is that most of humanity cannot conceive of the existence of any legitimate and functional motivation for behavior other than money, publicity, and power.” (p. 170). Mendenhall applies his distinction not only to **political structures** but also to **ecclesiastical structures**, which are power structures and suffer from the same social control (and therefore un-biblical) errors that are found in political or corporate structures. “A **community**, on the other hand, is a complex of persons who have something in common other than a power structure, and a value system in which economic well-being is not in the control of a centralized power structure” (p. 173) and has no goal except “the realization in the process of daily life of those values that make life Good.” (p. 174)
