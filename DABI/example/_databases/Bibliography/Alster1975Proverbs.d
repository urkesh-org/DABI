TO Sumerian proverbs and satire

In this paper, Alster describes a peculiar aspect of Sumerian wisdom texts, i.e. the use of proverbs and satirical expressions. The study underlines how humour, irony, and sarcasm are deliberately applied by ancient scribes as <<indirect means of communication which only make sense when seen in a tacit opposition to something else>> (p. 201). The rhetorical use of proverbs and satirical expressions aims at provoking an indirect effect on the reader: <<The effect of the indirect expression is much stronger than that of the direct one, but of course only if it is understood by the one to whom it is addressed. An even sharper effect will appear if the message is understood by a third person, but not by the one to whom it is addressed, or if it is placed in the mouth of one who does not himself understand it>> (p. 201). 

[This paper well exemplifies the mindset of ancient Sumerian scribes in writing wisdom compositions, recurring also to rhetorical expedients which allowed them to obtain an indirect, stronger, and sometimes alienating effect on the reader.]
