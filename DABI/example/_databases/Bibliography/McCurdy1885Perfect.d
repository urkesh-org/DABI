Having treated briefly of the morphology and of the statistical frequency of occurrence of the perfect, i.e. the permansive, in the various classes of texts (510-14), it deals at greater length with its
meaning and function, on the basis of a good documentation. It is
used indifferently for the active and the passive voice (514-16); in either case, it serves to express "permanent states
or conditions and characteristic qualities," and as such it is used
especially, for descriptive purposes, in relative clauses: description
of landscape, of conditions of natural objects, of habits and customsâ€”
hence the use as a permansive, first suggested by HINCKS, is correct
but accidental (516-19). In fact, the form is often used, "actively
and passively, to describe single, definite or momentary actions and
events represented as either past or present": this is deduced from the
general context, from the cooccurrence with finite tenses, and from
the desiderative use with *l&#363;* (519-21). Since there is no temporal limitation, it is not a perfect as in WSem.; rather it serves in the same manner as the Hebrew infinitive absolute and is in fact not derived
from the participles, but rather that "they are originally infinitives
or rather abstract nouns used as primary predicates and in this way
endowed with a regular verbal inflection" (522-29).
