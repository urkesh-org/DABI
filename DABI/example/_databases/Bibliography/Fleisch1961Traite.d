Though neither the *Esquisse* (which contains a simpler statement of the author's grammatical theory) nor the *Trait&eacute;* (where the theory is further developed and a wealth of material added from ancient Arab grammarians) deal in any way with Akkadian, both volumes are mentioned here because they provide an excellent application of some basic principles followed in my own grammar. This is true especially for internal inflection, which includes both lexical derivation (e. g. nominal patterns) and grammatical alternation (e. g. broken plural), but excludes the pronouns. Concerning the affixed patterns, the author follows the thsory which derives them from originally independent morphemes, whereby *&#8217;&#257;* (as preformative of the pattern *&#8217;af&#8219;alu*) is a "particule interjactive du language affectif," or *ma* a relative particle. One should not fail to appreciate the delightful French style, especially of the *Esquisse*.
