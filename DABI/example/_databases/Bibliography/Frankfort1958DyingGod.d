TO dying god; myths; comparative approach

This paper provides evidence of the inaugural lecture given by Frankfort as Director of the Warburg Institute and Professor of the History of Pre-Classical Antiquity in the University of London (in 1949). Frankfort selected the topic of the figure of the "dying god" as case-study aimed at investigating the relations between the Greeks and their predecessors in and around the Eastern Mediterranean. He believed that <<the variations in the cults and myths of this god are a good illustration of the extraordinary complexity which the problem of the survival of cultural forms may assume>> (p. 141).

In the opening paragraphs, Frankfort warns against the application of modern concepts to ancient ideas, and points out how a wrong approach, characterized by the use of abstractions and generalization in the analysis of other cultures, would prevent a profound comprehension of the phenomenon under investigation. <<The dying god is one of those imaginative conceptions in which early man made his emotional and intellectual preoccupations explicit. We disregard a great deal if we say that it expresses only man's concern with the course of the seasons>> (p. 143).

Frankfort describes in details, mentioning literary and mythical sources, different cases of dying gods in their specific cultural contexts, beginning with Tammuz in ancient Mesopotamia and continuing with Osiris (Egypt), Adonis and Attis (Syria and Anatolia). Then, turning to Greece, he discusses the divine figures of Hyakinthos, Persephone, and the mythus of Orpheus. Finally, the scholar asks whether the various conceptions of the dying god can be said to survive the cultural setting in which they were born. He admits that he himself had firstly said that only by avoiding generalizations a modern reader could do justice to the evidence. <<The most characteristic features, which are also the dominant features of each cult, never survive because each cult reflects the view which an ancient people took of the world in which it found itself>> (p. 150). And yet, Frankfort at the same time maintains that <<to deny survival in any form is surely absurd. (...) Our understanding of the Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Greek beliefs about a dying god is to some extent determined by a religious experience with which we ourselves are familiar>> (pp. 150-151).
