In this article, MacMahon investigates the Mesopotamian stepped temple towers known as ziggurats, taking into consideration their visibility within and beyond the city and analysing them in the context of the Near Eastern built landscapes. Firstly, the ideology and symbolic message of such iconic buildings are highlighted: being royally commissioned buildings, they reflected the kings’ ability to access resources and control labour, while also legitimising their authority. Furthermore, in their being divine abodes, ziggurats were also places where the divine and human worlds could meet. Ziggurats were at the same time ‘communal’, because they served the civic communities where they were placed - but their access was also strictly restricted to priests, royalty, and the elite.

MacMahon identifies a distinction between ziggurats that were built in the southern Mesopotamian plains (where any man-made structure was potentially highly visible) and those located in the Assyrian landscape, characterised by hills, river valleys and distant mountains (here, man-made structures needed greater scale, particularly vertical, to achieve the same visibility). The author also notes that ziggurats did not stand in isolation but were instead surreounded by other buildings of various functions, that would have restricted viewing. Interestingly, McMahon tries to reproduce the ancient perception of ziggurats seen "from below", even considering the interference to visibility given by dust haze and sandstorms that might have impaired the view in the past.

Through a careful analysis of the topography of ancient Mesopotamian cities, the scholar comes to the conclusion that «Given the surrounding buildings, terrace and courtyard walls, and winding streets, the full ziggurat would have been visible only from within its surrounding courtyard, at close range. The courtyard also may have invoked a psychological reaction. (...) This combination of huge open space and the ziggurat’s mass and height would have been visually dramatic, particularly in contrast to the crowded, narrow streets experienced on the journey through the city to the temple.» (pp. 331-332). Finally, McMahon analyzes the view "from the ziggurat": this offered a panoptic view on the entire city and its surroundings, potentially up to c. 18 km distant.
