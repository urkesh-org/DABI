A revision of Cantineau 1951-52 ("Consonantisme")
also in terms of articulatory phonetics. The
author objects to the tridimensional schemes of
Cantineau, which imply an equidistance of
voiceless, voiced and emphatic, and suggests
instead a "flat" scheme where the three sets
follow one another on the basis of glottal
opening: the glottis is closed with voiceless, "intermittent" with voiced, open with
emphatics. The general lack of labial emphatics
is then explained from an articulatory point
of view (p. 69). Emphasis in general is
explained as glottalization, and the aleph as
the marker of the whole series of emphatics;
*h,* on the other hand, is the marker of the
voiceless series. The interdentals are explained
as originally palatals or of a type "dorsal
ant&eacute;rieur" (74-ff.).
