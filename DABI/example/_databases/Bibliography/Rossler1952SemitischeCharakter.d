Libyan (i.e. ancient Libyan and modern Berber) is in Fact a Semitic language, particularly close to Akkadian, for which theory the author adduces phonological, lexical and morphological evidence. Special attention is paid to consonantal equivalences, for which 75 Libyan roots with Semitic correspondences are adduced, about half of these (30) having Akkadian equivalants, e.g. *lam&#257;du* "to learn" ~ Tu&#226;req *aelmed* "apprendre, comprendre..."; *nadru* "zornig, w&ouml;tend" ~ Tu&#226;reg *ti-&#285;orad* "force (physique), viguer." Similar equivalences are quotes for the pronouns (e.g. *an&#257;ku* ~ lib. *nak*), particles (*ana*, *ina* ~ *an*, *in*), and various morphemes (e.g. feminine *t*).

See the remarks by J.M. SOL&Agrave; SOL&Eacute;, M. COHEN and A. Basset in *GLECS* 6 (1951-54) 33-34; 41-42, who emphasize that ROSSLER'S position had already been maintained by M. COHEN, while at the same time criticizing ROSSLER for some aspects of his utilization of the Berber material.
