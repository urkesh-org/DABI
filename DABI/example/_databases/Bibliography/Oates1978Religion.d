This paper deals with the basic concepts of **religion** and **ritual**, underlining the reciprocal relation between the two entities. Religion is here specifically defined as <<a major **‘prime mover’** in the rise of civilized societies>> (p. 117). 

The author also underlines the intrinsic limits in knowledge for any prehistoric archaeologist, mostly because of the absence of writing.

Another topic involves the development of specialized ‘religious’ or ‘mortuary’ structures, sometimes entangled in the domestic context (as e.g. the benched-inhumation at [Çatalhöyük](http://www.catalhoyuk.com/), in Turkey; cf. {B}R/Hodder2010Emergence). 

The development of the social concept of religion and its practical actualizations in terms of rituality is then investigated, starting from Sumerian, Babylonian, and Anatolian contexts (with insights on the Iranian area). 

The focus then moves to **burial practices**, offering many examples from Mesopotamia and Syria. According to the author, the two concepts of ‘religion’ and ‘mortuary rituals’ are strictly connected (p. 118).
 
The author then analyses the difference between children’s and adult’s graves, underlining how sometimes children’s burial were denotated by a different assemblage, similarly as at [Urkesh/Tell Mozan](http://urkesh.org/) (see [Kharobi *et al.* 2014a](http://urkesh.org/abstracts/923Kharobietal2014a.htm) and [Kharobi *et al.* 2014b](http://urkesh.org/abstracts/923Kharobietal2014b.htm)). 

It follows a description of the ritual of *breaking objects* on occasion of burial rituals, together with the deposition of **clay figurines** (sometimes also depicted on potsherds), specifically the so-called **‘Mother Goddesses’** or **‘fertility figures’**, interpreted on the base of **ethnographical parallels** from modern African, American (Navaho), and Christian cultures. 

Briefly summarizing: <<We must conclude that despite some very interesting, at times even spectacular, evidence for what are certainly ritual practices, we know nothing about ‘religion’ behind them>> (p. 122).      

[The paper is particularly noteworthy for its attempt to define the concepts of ‘religion’, ‘magic’, and ‘rituals’ in ancient Mesopotamia, focusing on archaeological data and ethnographical parallels. The contribution helps in building a comparative approach in interpreting religious phaenomena on the base of actual archaeological evidence.]

TO religion

The definition of the concept of religion in ancient Mesopotamian thought is a difficult topic, sometimes lying on a slippery floor of evidence (both textual and archaeological); J. Oates presents an interesting definition, related to the political growth of the first civilisations: religion is <<a major **‘prime mover’** in the rise of civilized societies>> (see {B}R/Oates1978Religion, p. 117).

TO Mesopotamian religion

G. Buccellati presents in this section ancient Mesopotamian religion as one of the first historically attested (together with the Egyptian one). A worthy discussion about the basilar features of Mesopotamian religion can be found in {B}R/Oates1978Religion, dealing with the definition of ‘religion’ and the description of Mesopotamian ritual (specifically funerary) practices.

TO religion; magic

In this section G. Buccellati outlined a distinction between ‘religion’ and ‘magic’; even though such a demarcation is difficult to be traced for ancient Mesopotamia, an useful discussion on this topic can be found in {B}R/Oates1978Religion, dealing with the definition of ‘religion’ and the description of Mesopotamian ritual (specifically funerary) practices.

TO ritual practices

In this section G. Buccellati discusses about ancient actual realisation of ritual practices; {B}R/Oates1978Religion exemplifies in her contribution some particular Mesopotamian rituals and, more specifically, funerary practices (also involving ancestor cult).
