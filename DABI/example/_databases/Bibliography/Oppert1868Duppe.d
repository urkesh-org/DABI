The changes with respect to the first edition are listed on pp . XII-XV
of the introduction. The main innovations are: the distinction of
three types of aorist: simple in *-u*, apocopated, and paragogic in
*-anna*; a new paragraph on verbs double weak; and some bibliographical references, especially in the introduction (XV-XXIl): the main
thrust of these references is against Hincks (see also p. 117) who
had "imagined," next to the preterite, also the present and the permansive.
