A thorough monograph, with a comprehensive documentation of 451 examples (mostly OB and SB) given in transliteration and translation. It deals with syntactical and especially with notional categories, according to a conceptual scheme which I would reconstruct as follows:

<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=3>adjectives from transitive roots of action</td>
    <td>active permans</td>
    <td>agentive of control and possession: *&#231;abit* "he holds" agentive of persistency: *&#353;a'il* "he asks persistently" (refers to continuous action, often becoming iterative, and to the subject as engrossed in the action)</td>
	<td>pp. 238-48, 248-60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>active-descriptive</td>
    <td>active stative: *katim* "he covers" meaning "he is at the top" passive permansive instead of N stem: *ul &#7830;er&#299;at* "it has not been dug" ~ "it is undug" [i.e. oscillating between punctual and resultative]</td>
	<td>266-71, 279-85</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=3>descriptive permans</td>
    <td>passive stative: *sa&#7830;ir* "he is surrounded" [more properly belong here forms like *nadi* "he is thrown down" = "he lies"]</td>
	<td>278 f.; , 267-71</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>adjectives from roots of condition</td>
    <td>neuter stative: *damiq* "he is good"</td>
	<td>263-66</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>other non patterns from both roots; primary nouns</td>
    <td>permansive of substantive: *&#231;arr&#257;ku* "I am king" permansive of active participle: *k&#257;bis&#257;ku* "I am trading over"</td>
	<td>261-61</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The common denominator for all these various functions is that of changelessness, i.e. absence of change for roots of condition and lack of (potential) change for roots of action; conversely, it is postulated that prefix forms were reserved to espress fientic change, at least in the prehistory of the language (pp. 288-90; 310-3). Another prominent characteristic of the permansive is that it is protractive in aspect (249, 294-99), as a result of which the permansive is frequently used as the first predicate in a conjoined sentence used for virtual subordination: here the permansive is circumstantial in nature (271-8, 295, 300). Because of these usages, the permansive has an element of perfectivity, which at times becomes prominent, and which may have a bearing on the explanation of the NWSem. perfect (291-301). As for terminology, "permansive" is better than "stative" because it has a wider range and creates no confusion with the verbs of state (234 f., 299). A section on OA is included parenthetically on pp. 285-88. A recurrent observation is that contextual considerations are more important than in any other Semitic or modern European language to determine the choice between the very numerous functions of the permansive (e.g. 238, 291).
