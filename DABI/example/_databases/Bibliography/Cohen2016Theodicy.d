TO Divine wrath; Theodicy

Author’s summary: The present essay has come to challenge the idea that the Problem of **Theodicy** was introduced to Mesopotamian literature as a reaction to social or historical circumstances. First, support for historical or social catastrophic scenarios that allegedly promoted the rise of the critical discussion of divine retribution was denied. 

It was demonstrated that the Kassite and Post-Kassite periods, considered at times the  <<Middle Ages>>, were not as dire as portrayed. Moreover, it was shown that these historical eras were reconstructed from the very sources they were supposed to have inspired, when literature was understood as a historical document in its narrowest sense. 

Secondly, it was argued that with a growing and substantial corpus of works dating to the Old Babylonian and Post-Old Babylonian period, it is now possible to trace some of the ideas found in Kassite and Post-Kassite texts to older proverbs and wisdom compositions. The questioning of **divine retribution** by the **Righteous Sufferer** in a number of works, the realization of the incomprehensibility of the god(s)’s way, the reversibility of man’s fate, and the rejection of material wealth or goods, as part of a nihilistic trend, were all seen to be found, in one way or the other, in these early compositions. They all stem from the confrontation with the Problem of **Theodicy**, without any particular catastrophe looming in their background, either explicitly or implicitly, wishing to answer a question common to many religious systems, Why is there suffering in the world of the (innocent) believer. (p. 270)

[**Cohen’s article examines and refutes the explanations of Thorkild Jacobsen, Wilfred Lambert, Rainer Albertz, and Karel van der Toorn**. In his view, their theories about theodicy suffer from a lack of independent historical data, which relativizes or contradicts the assumptions upon which their explanations rest. Cohen therefore attempts to rectify the situtation with **new data** and arrives at the conclusion that the problem of Theodicy accompanied Babylonian religious reflection from its beginning, and did not arise in reaction to a cultural or economic shift, as claimed for instance by Nagy. <<Questioning divine reward and punishment and the introduction of sceptical or critical attitudes are constant themes in Mesopotamian wisdom literature; hence an evolutionist historical scenario is not needed to explain their appearance and development.>> (p. 245)
Cohen also expands the concept of theodicy to refer not only to a blameless sufferer (as Bricker proposed), but more broadly to the <<attempt to explain in religious terms suffering or evil.>> (p. 246) From the beginning, religious people have reflected on the **failure of the principle of divine retribution** to explain the actual situation of the world.]
