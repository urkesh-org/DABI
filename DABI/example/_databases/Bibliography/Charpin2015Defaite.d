TO divine anger

<<In ancient Mesopotamia, the divinity that chastises is not conceived as a sort of impassible judge who delivers sentences in a detached manner: the god punishes because the fault of man has provoked his anger.>> (p. 1) Charpin supports this thesis with texts taken from four centuries at the beginning of the second millenium BCE in Aleppo. The first examples given are invocations of maledictions on enemies. They express the desire that, given certain conditions, the rage of the god be expressed toward a guilty party. A second group of examples regard situations in which divine rage is used to explain common events, especially sickness and sudden death. 

A third example regards a text in which Addu of Kallassu asks the reigning king to give him what he asks, and threatens revenge if he does not. The text continues with a request from Addu of Aleppo, who simply asks that the king render justice to the people, and makes no counter-threat. To Charpin, this last, for the first time in recorded history, seems to presage a future in which justice for all is more important than the god's feelings of anger. 

[Charpin and Buccellati are at odds regarding whether or not the god passes judgement on the basis of a pre-existing law or not. See {N}R/8.4.]

TO judge; legislator; nominalism; divine anger

The Hymn to Shamash, partially translated and published in appendix 3 to "*When on High...*", describes the god as a judge who applies a pre-existing law. Note for instance verse 98: "you impose a punishment on him who perverts justice to pocket a bribe." Buccellati compares this situation to that of Hammurabi, who is a judge more than a legislator. According to Charpin, on the other hand, the god does not obey a higher law that has ontological coherence. Rather, the god punishes because he is angry. See: ({B}R/Charpin2015Defaite).
