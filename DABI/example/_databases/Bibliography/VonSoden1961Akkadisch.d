Special circumstances have been the cause of the neglect of Akkadian within the field of Semitics: the first texts discovered were ill-suited for grammatical reconstruction, the rules of orthography are not sufficiently considered, an excessive importance is given to the influence of Sumerian. As a result, some scholars seem to think that one can translate Akkadian with approximation and guesses rather than with the exact precision of grammatical rules. Yet Akk. has contributed already, to the field of Semitics, a great deal of insights, which the author reviews with important observations of details on pp. 36-47 (see esp. about the about the verbal system on pp. 41-45). In the final section, the most promising areas of study for future research are pointed out, especially dialectal studies, meaning classes with roots and patterns, tense and mood in the verb and in general syntactical problems.
