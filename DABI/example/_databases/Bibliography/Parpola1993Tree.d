Parpola proposes an interpretation of the meaning of the **Mesopotamian Tree motif** found throughout the Near East, which appears in many variants but essentially <<consists of a trunk with a palmette crown standing on the stone base and surrounded by a network of horizontal or intersecting lines fringed with palmettes, pinecones, or pomegranates.>> (p. 164). The lack of textual evidence renders interpretation difficult. Parpola builds on existing interpretations which indicate that the tree represents both the divine world order, and the king as the realization of that order in man, a perfect man.

Parpola’s contribution rests on the hypothesis that the **Sefirotic Tree of Life** derives directly from the Mesopotamian Tree. It contains the dual symbolism already mentioned, in that it refers to the order of creation, and also to man as a microcosm created in the image of God. This hypothesis can be tested, in Parpola’s opinion, by replacing the elements of the Sefirotic Tree with corresponding gods and mystic numbers from the Mesopotamian pantheon. The result (summarized in the diagram on pp. 179 and 183) is coherent and provides further paths for discovery: Assur is missing from the diagram, but can be identified with the winged disk over the Assyrian Tree. Furthermore, the tree is composed of “three successive generations of gods appearing horizontally as interrelated trinities” (p. 187). Still more, the distribution of the mystic numbers derived from the Mesopotamian gods correspond to the positive, negative, and equilibrium features of the three pillars of the Sefirotic tree. Parpola shows this with a neat arithmetic argument, which in his view <<amounts to mathematical proof of the correctness of the reconstruction.>> (p. 189)

In the third part of his article, **Parpola extends the logic of the tree to three concrete examples to show how it enriches the understanding of Mesopotamian religion**. First, he notes that the incipit of *Enuma elis* can be better understood through a mathematical rephrasing: <<When the primordial state of undifferentiated unity (Apsu + Mummu + Tiamat, <<0>>), in which nothing existed, came to an end, nothingness was replaced by the binary system of oppositions (Lahmu and Lahamu) and the infinite universe (Ansar = Assur) with its negative counterpart (Kisar). Assur emanated Heaven (Anu) as his primary manifestation, to mirror his existence to the world. Thus rephrased, the passage
comes very close to Kabbalistic and Neoplatonic metaphysics.>> (p. 191). Second, the Epic of Gilgamesh can likewise be better understood by realizing that it is structured after the Tree, which gives tablet XII a mystical interpretation as summarized on p. 196. Finally, the Etana myth can be re-interpreted through the tree motif and understood as <<presenting Etana as the first man to achieve the ascent [to heaven], it forcefully contributes to the notion of the Mesopotamian king as the ‘perfect Man’>> (p. 197).
Parpola concludes that <<against all appearances, Mesopotamian religion and philosophy are not dead but still very much alive in Jewish, Christian, and Oriental mysticism and philosophies. The Tree diagram provides the key which makes it possible to bridge these different traditions and to start re- covering the forgotten *summa sapientia* of our cultural ancestors.>> p. 199.

The article also contains a catalog of tree and winged disc symbols, and three interesting excurses.
