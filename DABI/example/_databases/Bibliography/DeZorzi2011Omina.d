TO body parts; symbolic associations; omen

A typological classification of the omina according to the **formal organization of body parts** in the malformed fetus reduces the entire corpus to five categories: malformation, absence, incompleteness, misplacement, excess.

A "hermeneutic" analysis recognizes **sets of symbolic associations** that pertain to discrete elements, e. g.: "the head, the upper part of the body, is associated with the king; the neck, which anatomically connects the head with the rest of the body, symbolizes royal power" (p. 54), and to the nature of the malformation, e.g., if the fetus looks like a lion, then the reference is to "the king, royal power and military strength" (p.61).

The concluding part "investigates **mechanisms of association** that create links between protases and apodoses through the use of paronomasia and other words of word-play" (p. 67). The article gives a large number of well chosen examples, and includes an up-to-date bibliography.

As for the relationship between protases and apodoses, {B}R/DeZorzi2011Omina identifies a "binary logic", expressed through pairs of extreme regularity such as right/left whose corresponding apodoses fall into the opposing categories of favourable/unfavourable predictions. Then, she analyzes symbolic associations connected to the symbolism of the body (i.e. head = the king, neck = royal power, eyes = water management and prosperity, etc.). Interestingly, De Zorzi also describes particular combination of signs which were hermeneutically linked to other associations of ideas: thus, in investigating the omina contained in the series &#352;umma izbu one should not forget that the scribes who composed this collection were clearly aware of the possibilities offered by their writing system in terms of polysemy and polyphony and made ample use of them in their attempt to discover layers of meaning in their material.
