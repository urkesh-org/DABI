TO Mesopotamian religion; rituality; exorcisms; omina; mythology; spirits; divination; magic

This masterpiece in the introduction to Near Eastern culture, and specifically to Babylonian culture, devotes chapter 4 to the topic of **religion** and **rituality** in the ancient Mesopotamian world. 

The title given by the author to the chapter (taken from Hölderlin) is indicative of the particular perspective adopted in investigating such a topic: <<Nah ist -- und schwer zu fassen der Gott>>; this particular feature leads the author to approach the thematic of Mesopotamian religion also under a **psychological perspective** (see specifically pp. 198ff.).

The first paragraph presents another tricky sentence: <<Why a ‘Mesopotamian religion’ should not be written>>. The author explains this statement advancing the problems of the <<nature of the available evidence>> and that of <<comprehension across the barriers of **conceptual conditioning**>> (p. 172). The author describes how the archaeological evidence is still not well understood in its actual function, and the textual attestations are difficult to be interpreted as briefly expressed on p. 175: <<In short, how truthfully do they [i.e. written sources] reveal what is commonly meant by religion?>>; this last assertion is strictly connected to the general problem of interpreting the past, an interpretation affected by the trouble of the existence of a [**broken tradition**](https://critique-of-ar.net/themes/broken.htm).

Nevertheless, the author continues in describing the nature and contents of Mesopotamian texts related to religion, focusing on the metaphysical nature of Mesopotamian deities, on the role of the king as interpreter of the divine will, and on the role of some specific and peculiar religious texts involving **exorcisms** or ***omina***, presented in a continuum crossing several millennia.
  
The following paragraph (pp. 183ff.) focuses on the care and feeding of the gods, i.e. on the ritual daily practices performed in temples to acquaintance the gods and to obtain their benevolence, describing the organization of ritual aspects in Mesopotamian society (offering parallels with Egyptian culture and with the Old Testament).
     
An interesting paragraph (pp. 198ff.) deals with **Mesopotamian ‘psychology’**, involving the relationship between individuals and deities: in this respect, <<the deity is sometimes felt to be the leader, patron, or protector of groups, be these families or professional and religious associations>> (p. 198). The discussion continues with a description of **Mesopotamian mythology** and with the inclusion, in the personal and psychological experience, of the existence of four protective **‘spirits’** which <<are individualized and mythologized carriers of certain specific psychological aspects of one basic phaenomenon, the realization of the **self**, the personality, as it relates the ego to the outside world and, at the same time, separates one from the other>> (pp. 198-199).

The last paragraph (pp. 206ff.) is devoted to the presentation of the arts of the **diviner**, emphasizing the importance of **divination** in Mesopotamian culture and mind: <<Basically, divination represents a technique of communication with the supernatural forces that are supposed to shape the history of the individuals as well as that of the group>> (p. 207). The paragraph goes on describing the different actual divination practices attested in Mesopotamian texts, such as the **throwing of lots**, the **lecanomancy**, and the **libanomancy** (pp. 207f.), all described as both operational and **magical techniques** owned and performed by special priests.   

[The volume discusses many aspects of ancient Mesopotamian religion. The most interesting portion of the chapter is indeed at the very beginning, where the author addresses a challenging statement, “Why a ‘Mesopotamian religion’ should not be written”: the author discusses the very definition of the word ‘religion’ in ancient Mesopotamian culture, explaining how the whole complex of religious beliefs can be grasped only through the analysis of its actual realisations, i.e. the Mesopotamian cultic practices, within a psychological perspective.]

TO Mesopotamian mythology

An interesting approach on Mesopotamian mythology is displayed in {B}R/Oppenheim1964Mesopotamia, where the author describes the recourse to myths within a psychological approach, e.g. in the definition of ‘spirits’ which <<are individualized and mythologized carriers of certain specific psychological aspects of one basic phaenomenon, the realization of the self, the personality, as it relates the ego to the outside world and, at the same time, separates one from the other>> (pp. 198-199).
