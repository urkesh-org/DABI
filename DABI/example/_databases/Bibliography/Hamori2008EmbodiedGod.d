In this monograph, the author explores the portrayal of God as found in *Gen.* 18.1-15 and 32.23-33: there, the Biblical God is depicted as interacting with humans in anthropomorphically realistic form, a phenomenon that Hamori labels the "*'&#238;&#353;* theophany".

The volume analyses the history of scholarship, looking at how scholars have - or rather have not - investigated the many varieties of anthropomorphic portrayal of deities which serve different narrative and theological functions in human religions. She states that so far, the only difference which has been made is the one between anthropomorphism and anthropopathism, also called "physical" and "psychical" anthropomorphism. The author, instead, identifies and describes a "taxonomy" of physical anthropomorphism, whose forms she identifies as concrete, envisioned, immanent, transcendent and figurative.

In chapter 6, Hamori offers a survey of Mesopotamian cases of divine anthropomorphism, with the purpose of describing <<the place of anthropomorphically realistic portrayal of deity within the broader scope of ancient Near Eastern mythology>> (p. 129). From this survey, she infers that a pattern exists throughout the Mesopotamian religious literary texts, <<of a general movement in the direction of greater division between heaven and earth as separate realms>> (p. 143) starting from the Sumerian material till the late Akkadian texts. 

When comparing the Biblical and the Mesopotamian material, thus, Hamori concludes that <<The phenomenon of the *'&#238;&#353;* theophany has no counterpart in Akkadian mythology any more than in Sumerian. There appears to be no stage of Mesopotamian thought as reflected in texts from the Sumerian mythology through the late Akkadian material in which divine beings break into the earthly realm in fully anthropomorphically realistic form in order to engage with humans. There is then no period or body of material in which anthropomorphic realism and direct corporeal divine-human contact coexist in Mesopotamia. So far, this mode of divine-human communication is only attested in Biblical literature.>>
