TO divine will; divine wrath

[Author's summary] The Chronist speaks of divine wrath, but it is a "cold" wrath, deeply reflected and integrated into the dogma of retribution. This is not surprising in a historiographic work that enjoys a certain officialness. On the other hand, the notion of divine repentence is almost entirely lacking in the Chronist. He does however speak of YHWH as compassionate and merciful: He gives man a chance to repent and convert.

[The Chronist's view, as presented by Mathys, is that the **divine will follows an immutable law**: for YHWH to "repent" would be to act unjustly. He can however delay retribution, and thus give man the opportunity to repent and escape punishment.]

TO polytheism; divine law

For a reading of YHWH's actions that looks similar to Buccellati's interpretation of polytheism, in that YHWH follows an immutable law that is in a sense "above" himself, see: {B}R/Mathys2015Colere. In this reading, YHWH's mercy lies in delayed retribution.
