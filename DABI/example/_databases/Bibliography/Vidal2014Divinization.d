TO royal divinization

The aim Vidal's article is to review recent academic contributions on the issue of royal divinization in ancient Mesopotamia and to assess the real meaning of "royal divinization" in the different Mesopotamian societies in which such phenomenon is witnessed. Vidal then analyzes instances of royal divinization across time, spanning from the Early-Dinastic kings to the specific case of Naram-Sin, from the kings of Ur III to those of the Isin-Larsa and Old-Babylonian periods.

According to the author, such diachronic review shows how, in Mesopotamia, the political power ultimately resorted to theological speculation in order to try to solve immediate problems and ideological challenges. In the specific case of Naram-Sin, Vidal identifies the reasons for his divinization in the lack of a patron deity for the recently-founded capital city of Akkad, which made it incapable of competing on the religious plan with cities of long tradition such as Ur, Uruk or Nippur. During the Third Dinasty of Ur, under the government of Ur-Nammu and his successors, Mesopotamia became a strongly centralized country whose territories were subordinate to a new state with capital in Ur. However, from a religious point of view, Ur could not claim the theological legitimacy that other cities whose existence was attributed to divine foundation could instead claim. Thus, the kings of Ur opted for their own divinization so as to endowing the state with a religious legitimacy that would consolidate its position: the state led by Ur also had a patron god, and he was the king.

Finally, after the disappearance of the Ur III empire, different cities disputed its inheritance and used the same ideological tools to justify their claims. Thus, the city of Isin promoted a new version of the well-known Sumerian Royal List - in which Isin was depicted as a continuator of the political hegemony of Ur. Likewise, the kings of Isin itself (and some kings of Larsa and Ešnunna) saw in the phenomenon of royal divinization a further resource to present themselves as direct and legitimate continuators of the divinized kings of Ur.
