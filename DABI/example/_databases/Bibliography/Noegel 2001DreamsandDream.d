Noegel aims to investigate the topic of dreams and their interpretations through the Mesopotamian evidence and the Hebrew Bible. He mostly adopts Oppenheim's classification of dreams between "message" dreams, in which a god or important figure appears and delivers a missive to the dreamer, and "symbolic" dreams, in which the dreamer witnesses enigmatic visual images that require an interpretation. He implements Oppenheim's basic typologies by making a clear distinction between literary and historical texts, and taking into consideration the overlaps existing within such quite simple and schematic classification.

Noegel begins by surveying the abudant Mesopotamian evidence, available in a variety of textual genres including ritual, oracular, epistolary, historical, dedicatory, and literary texts. Particular attention is given to the collection of dream oracles known as the *Babylonian Dream Book*, to its content as well as literary and stylistic features; also ritual texts complementing that compendium of symbolic dreams (the so-called *namburb&#251;*) are described in details.

Particularly relevant to Buccellati's volume is the comparison made by Noegel between Mesopotamian and Biblical views on dreams, which appears in the second part of this article.

Noegel highlights differences between the two cultural words: in Mesopotamia, dreams were associated with gods or demons - the Israelite's belief system, instead, left little room for any agent (mechanical or divine) other than Yahweh, also in the dreaming and interpretive process. Also the role and characterization of the interpreter was radically different: the Bible, indeed, forbids "foreign" religio-mantic acts (Deut. 13:2-6, 18:9-15) and consistently portrays foreigners as not having the divine wisdom, like Israelites, to decipher enigmatic dreams.

However, Noegel also finds some similarities in these two cultural words: firstly, they both say dreams as divine in origin. Then, in both cultures the deity was perceived as a judge; there was a strong belief in the performative power of words;and the *lex talionis* constituted a legal, theological, and literary principle.

Noegel thus believes that, despite their cultural and theological differences, Mesopotamian texts and the Bible share a great deal in common with respect to dreams and their interpretations - both in details and in conceptual framework. He also maintains that the Mesopotamian parallels helps to appreciate better Israelite references to dreams in the Bible's prophetic corpus. These texts mirror the development in Israelite attitudes toward dreams and prophecy as a cultural institution, following the growing Assyrian political, military, and cultural predominance in the Near East from the eight century BCE onward.
