TO mythology; religious sentiment

An interpretative study by an eminent scholar who, besides describing mythology and cults, also faces the question of religious "sentiment": this treatise comes close to my emphasis on spirituality, but remains on rather general lines. An important contribution of this volume lies in the rich repertory of texts given in translation.
