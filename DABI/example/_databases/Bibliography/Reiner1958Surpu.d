This volume consists in an edition of the series *Šurpu*: it includes transliteration, translation and limited commentary. 
The purpose of the ritual and incantation series *Šurpu* (lit. "Burning") was to free a sufferer from a divine curse or punishment, inflicted to him/her due to personal misconduct (which might have been conscious or inconscious). The series mostly consists of incantations recited during the ceremony, supplemented by brief ritual instructions. One ritual tablet provides details on the entire ceremony.
