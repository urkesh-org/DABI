Critical remarks about the traditional methods of comparative Semitics, followed by a typological study of single representative phenomena and a reassessment of inner-Semitic relationship. The causative and pronominal morpheme *&#353;/s* is common not only in Akkadian and South-Arabic, but also in "Hamitic"; besides, it is also found to a limited extent in NWSemitic (except Aramaic) and Arabic, whereas the parallel morpheme h is not found outside of the latter two groups; hence *&#353;/s* (as in Akkadian) is archaic, whereas h is a NWSemitic innovation. Similar is the situation for the Akkadian interrogative pronouns *mannum-m&#299;num,* formed of the adeictic pronominal theme m plus the deictic element n, and equally archaic. From a general point of view and with special reference to morphology, Akkadian is the most archaic Semitic language. Unitary linguistic traits among Semitic languages are the result of developments from the second millennium on (neo Semitic); for the archaic phase it is more difficult to pressuppose true linguistic unity, particularly between Akkadian and West Semitic. Rather, one should investigate possible isoglosses between single Semitic languages and "Hamitic" groups (very tentatively, a parallel is suggested between Akkadian and Cushitic— both of which exhibit the verb in final position).
