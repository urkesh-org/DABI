The original, Proto-Semitic function of mimation/nunation was to serve as a marker of determination for the noun. At this stage, the marker was reserved for (1) definite substantives, i.e. determined and
individualized (e.g. "the man") whereas lack of the same marker served for both (2) generic, i.e. non-determined and non individualized,
substantives ("man") and (3) indefinite, i.e. non-determined but individualized substantives ("a man"). This system was altered by extension
of nunation to serve for (2) as well as for (l): this alteration can
easily beattested in terms of general linguistics, where substantives
of semantic classes without opposition between individual and species,
i.e. substantives naturally generic like "sky,” become determined as
in English "the sky.” To resolve the ambiguity between definite and
generic, both of which had come to be expressed by nunation, Arabic introduced a new marker, originally demonstrative, i.e. the definite article
*'al-* (cf. French "le loup" generic and "ce loup" definite); as a result
nunation was extended to cover both generic and indefinite. In this
way a complete shift had occurred in the use of nunation from a marker
of determination to marker of indetermination. In Akk. (see esp. p.
323 and 328) mimation reflects the second stage where it had been
extended beyond determination, but was still retained for determination.
Hence the contrast with Arabic is apparent, and can be explained historically.
