In the opening paragraphs of this article, the author provides a detailed overview of previous scholarship in history of religions and Assyriology devoted to the understanding of the ultimate social and cultural purpose of the Akitu festival. Sommer focuses in particular on the works published by the historian of religion J. Z. Smith, who suggested that the festival functioned as a piece of national-religious propaganda.

Sommer suggests that, through a careful reading of the ritual instructions for the Akitu festival, it is possible to identify a cosmogonic function according to which the Esagila temple, and hence the world, were symbolically razed, purified, and re-created. At the same time kingship, and hence cosmic order, were symbolically abolished and renewed. Sommer provides written evidence in support of his idea that the Akitu festival restored order by temporarily undermining it stems - by analyzing different phases of the ritual, the symbolism of fire and water, the so-called "negative confession" pronounced by the king and the prayers recited by priests and singers. «The nexus between Esagila’s (re)building and the world’s creation must have been particularly clear to the ritual’s participants, who were well aware that Esagila had originally been built by the gods as capstone of the universe. After all, only one day earlier, at the outset of the festival, *Enuma Elish* had been recited. The relevance of this poem to the Akitu festival lies especially in the nature of the creation it depicts.» (p. 89).
