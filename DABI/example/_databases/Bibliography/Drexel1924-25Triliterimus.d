1. Distinguishes three main types of nouns: those which are originally nominal and are not necessariy triradical (nominal root), those which are from roots nominal and verbal at the same time (e.g. b£lu "lord" "to rule"); and the nominal deverbalia which are derived from originally verbal roots by means of "innere Nominalbildung" or of "akkreszive Elemente" (internal and external inflection). For various reasons, descriptive and comparitive (pp. 233-35) the verb is considered primary over the noun, and more precisely in the basic stem. 2. Criticizes in detail the reasons adduced by others in favor of the priority of the aorist (= preterite) over the perfect (= stative): the last vowel of the aorist is neither more varied (esp. in Akkadian), nor more regular than in the perfect (251 ff.); there is nothing to prove that pre fixation is a frozen and therefore older morphological process (258 f.); there is no general basis to the claim that expression of the present antecedes that of the past (258 f.); the "Hamitic" languages do not prove the priority of the aorist (259 ff.); the aorist cannot be derived from the imperative, esp. in Akkadian (262 ff.). Instead, the perfect is considered primary, because nominal forms may be more easily derived from it, and because Egyptian has no aoris (272 ff.). 3. Verbal roots (as they appear in the primary form of the perfect) may be divided in three categories: originary (e.g. from the previous two elements ga/er "to end, boundary" and ba/o "to go"); derivative (e.g. Akk. ger£bu "to approach" from the previous two elements), and determinative (the weak verbs, which add determinative elements, to originary verbs). Triradicalism is thus a secondary phenomenon, which was accepted more systematically in Semitic than in Hamitic. The final section is about onomatopoetic verbs, with particular regard for reduplication.
