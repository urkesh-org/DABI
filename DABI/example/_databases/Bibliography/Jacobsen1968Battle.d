TO battle; Marduk; Tiamat

The author examines the battle between Marduk and Tiamat in Enuma elish. He first examines the meaning of the two names. Tiamat is clearly identified as the sea. The meaning of the name Marduk is less clear, but strong reasons point to a meaning of Son of the storm (rather than Son of the Sun, another possible reading). A **battle between the storm and the sea** is also the motif of a myth from Ras-Shamra in Ugarit, which can be dated to the same period as Enuma elish. Did the East influence the West, or vice versa? Jacobsen proposes that the **motif originated in the Mediterranean environment rather than in Babylon**, because the sea is not a part of everyday life in Babylon, whereas it is in Ugarit. Finally, Jacobsen proposes that the motif was brought to Babylon late, with the Amorites.
