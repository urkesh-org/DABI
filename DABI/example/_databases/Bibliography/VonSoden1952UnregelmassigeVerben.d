Discussion of forms deviating from the established verbal system, with vast documentation from all periods. The roots in question are: *uzuzzum* and *ut&#363;lum* (in both cases forms are derived from various alternate roots, in contrast especially to Poebel's single triconsonantal roots): *n&#257;danum*, *na&#39;&#257;dum* (*&#39;id*) and *n&#226;dum* (*n&#257;d*) which follow mostly the basic system, except for a few deviating forms; *&#42;na&#231;&#231;*, defective and attested only in Assyrian, *utlell&#363;m*, possibly a form with reduplication from *el&#363;m* and *utnennu,* connected with a root *&#42;unnunu*.
