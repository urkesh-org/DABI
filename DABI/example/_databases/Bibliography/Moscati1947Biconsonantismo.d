After reviewing in detail the pertinent literature from the Middle Agas on, three main
qualifications of biconsonantism are given:
biconsonantism in logical (i. e. two identical
consonants are found in several sets of words
with similar meaning), historical (i. e.
biconsonantal roots are earlier), and partial
(not *all* roots are biconsonantal). The "determinatives,"
 i. e. consonants which are added
to derive triconsonantals from biconsonantals,
occur in initial, middle and especially final
position. Four examples of biconsonantals wit
triconsonantal derivatives are given.
