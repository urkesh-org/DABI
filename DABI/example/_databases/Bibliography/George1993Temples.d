This volume consists in a complete edition of all cuneiform tablets inscribed with list of temples, plus a complete 'gazetteer' of ceremonial temple names. Within temple lists, a number of semantic principles according to which the ancient shrines were ordered in the written sources may be recognized: thematic, acrographic, theological, hierarchial, and topographical. The 'gazetteer' provides (where known) location, divine owner, and other relevant information for each temple listed. It may be noted that some temple names are rather elaborate, with cosmic or cultic allusions that are not always clear for a modern reader.
