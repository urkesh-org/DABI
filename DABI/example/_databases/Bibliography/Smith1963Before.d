TO human nature; Genesis 3; knowledge of good and evil

Christian tradition interprets Genesis 3 as a "fall" and an "original sin", whose nature is understood as disobedience or rebellion. Recent scholarship is critical of this view. Smith affirms that the biblical text itself seems to be first of all an etiology about the condition of serpents, women, and men in the world. He proposes that **Genesis 3 focuses on a psychological representation of human nature as a trajectory from desire, through knowledge, to fear and difficulty**. This trajectory then points to evil proper in chapters 4 and 6. 

Smith points out that the **knowledge of good and evil is present in the garden before evil is committed by humans**, and the tree that represents this knowledge is desirable "for making one wise". "In Genesis desire, not evil, is the first term of the human person." A second term is fear, which "follows in the wake of knowing good and evil". Finally, the outcome of the choices made by the man and the woman is "difficulty". For Smith, "it is enough to indicate what the vocabulary of Genesis 3 does name in the human condition: not sin or disobedience or transgression, but desire, knowledge of good and evil, fear, desire again, and difficulty."

[Smith's treatment is erudite and precise, but it seems to lack an adequate appreciation for the breakage that Genesis 4 and 6 describe. While not explicit in the text, the traditional reading of Genesis 3 as the breaking/fragmentation of the relationship between man and God does account for the subsequent fragmentation of interpersonal relations in Genesis 4. This is the alternative proposal in *When on high*: what one may call original sin seems to be the very origin of polytheism.]
