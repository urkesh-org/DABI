TO sacrifice and divination in Babylonia and Assyria

The author collects and comments in this volume many **sacrificial and divinatory texts** of Babylonian and Assyrian origin, dividing them into different, specific categories, such as the series *Maqlû*, *Šurpu*, and sacrifices performed at Babylon during the *akītu* festival, i.e. the New-Year Festival in honour of the polyad god [Marduk](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/marduk/index.html).
   
[The volume exemplifies sacrificial and divinatory practices in both Babylonia and Assyria during a long chronological span, focusing on the most important texts reporting such practices, many of them specifically mentioned by G. Buccellati in his book.]
