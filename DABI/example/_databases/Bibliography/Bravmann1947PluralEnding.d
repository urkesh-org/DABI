Here goes the **summary**.
By analogy with the endings *-&#363;/-&#257;* for the masculine and feminine plural of the adjective in its predicative function [stative], a new ending *-&#363;t- for the masculine plural of the attributive adjective was introduced next to the already existing ending *-&#257;t-* of the feminine plural.
