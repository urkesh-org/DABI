TO Sumerian King List

This paper provides a useful assessment of the text known as the "Sumerian King List", which is defined as "a composition halfway between a literary text and a list proper, which deals with the history of kingship in Babylonia from the beginning of time to the early centuries of the second millennium BC." (p. 231).

Marchesi offers a remarkable collection of bibliography on this peculiar text, incuding reference to its *editio princeps* (by Jacobsen, dated 1839) and to many manuscripts published in more recent years. The Sumerian King List is fully acknowledged as a complex and composite literary work, with a long redactional history: it is indeed a document of exceptional interest in its providing modern readers with a reconstruction of the history of early Babylonia by the Babylonians themselves.

Marchesi highlights "the absence of any theological speculation" in this text, also proved by the fact that no deity plays a role in the story that it reveals. Similarly to what is stated by Buccellati in ยง16.5, Marchesi recognised that, indeed, kingship itself is considered as a "divine entity": it descends from heaven, and as such it is considered as a divine institution. Still, from its descent on the earth onward kingship is trasferred from one city to the other exclusively as a consequence of military (i.e. human) events (p. 234).
