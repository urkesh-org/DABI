Akkadian *-i&#353;* (seldom also *-a&#353;*) is to be related to Ugaritic-Canaanite *-ah* not only functionally but also because both endings are identical in origin, as they are both diectic in nature, corresponding to the distribution of *&#353;* and *h* in Semitic as defended elsewhere by Speiser (1935; 1947; 1952) Hence the original meaning of the terminative is assumed to have been deictic < with some such meaning as "away towards a specific point">: for "earth-towards," for example, <Semitic employed "earth-that."> (p. 503).
