TO sacred prostitution

Taking the famous passage written by Herodotus on sacred prostitution in Babylonian temples as a starting point, Roth sets out to investigate the social and legal tensions between marriage and nonmarital relations - thus also confronting what she calls the «specter of the "sacred prostitute" raised by Herodotus» which, she believes, needs «to be eliminated from the discussion.» (p. 23). Drawing similar conclusions than the ones stated by Goodnick Westenholz in 1989 (cf. {B}R/Westenholz1989Tamar), Roth writes: «It is clear that, other than this highly restricted and structured "sacred marriage," there was no ritualized or institutionalized sexual intercourse associated with Mesopotamian religions or temples. Neither female nor male cultic personnel, thether linked ritually or only lexically (...), can be identified as female or male prostitutes or catamites.» (pp. 23-24).
