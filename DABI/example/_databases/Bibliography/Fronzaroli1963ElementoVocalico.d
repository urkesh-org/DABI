Primitive (or unmotivated) nouns do not exhibit apophonic alternation in their vocalism, nor can one establish semantic classes of such words based on vocalic differentiations hence the vowel of primitive nouns is part of the lexeme, not of morphology (internal inflection). The same conclusion is suggested for the imperative and prefixed verbal forms of the B stem of verbs of action, as well as for the suffixed verbal forms of the verbs of state.
