Johnston's article has quite an ambitious goal: to offer a comparative analysis of Babylonian and Greek poetry and theology, mostly through an analisys of two literary works - the Babylonian *Poem of the Righteous Sufferer* (dated to the late second millennium BCE), and the so-called *Elegy to the Muses* (fragment 13 West, probably composed in the sixth century BCE by the Athenian statesman and poet Solon). In particular, the author aims to «show that in the two poems, shifts in the identity and perspective of the poetic voice play a central role in theological argumentation, enabling the speaker to act out, or perform, a vision of humanity and the divine in a way that could intersect with, and potentially inflect, the beliefs and opinions of individuals.» (p. 64).

Both literary works reflect on crucial theological questions, concerning divine justice, human suffering and the possibility of obtaining knowledge and wisdom – and they do so within the framework of an elaborate poetic structure. Thus, Johnston says, they operate both as vehicles for theological thought and as literary artefacts.
