The change *a* > *e* next to gutturals is difficult to explain from an articulatory point of view because a is more homogeneous than e with those consonants. Hence it must be postulated that the fricatives laryngeals and velar ('3-5 and possible '?) "shifted to the palatal position before disappearing," a phenomenon similar to the change from Latin carum to French chair "flesh." On the basis of this assumption the author goes on to explain a number of Akkadian examples.
