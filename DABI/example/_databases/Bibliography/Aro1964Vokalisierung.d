The main criterion for the internal classification of the Semitic verbal system is the <b>polarity between stative and fientive verbs</b>, even though there are no Semitic languages in which such a differentiation is perfectly operative. Akkadian is the language most affected by it, Hebrew and Arabic show considerable traces, while in Aramaic and Ethiopie the distinction is hardly apparent. The languages just mentioned are dealt with separately in five chapters. The one in Akkadian, like the other ones, consists almost exclusively of lists of verbal forms, arranged according to vocalization (present-preterite for Akkadian) and meaning (always for the B stem).
 
The <b>main conclusions</b> (ch. VII and VIII) are: (1) transitive fientive verbs are primarily of the types <i>iparras</i> : <i>iprus</i> ( = <i>qatala</i> : <i>yaqtulu</i>) and <i>iparris</i> : <i>ipris</i> ( = <i>qatala</i> : <i>yaqtilu</i>); (2) no clear vocalic class, and no correlation between Akkadian and West Semitic, exist for intransitive-fientive verbs; (3) stative verbs occur with a vocalism <i>a-a</i>, but especially with <i>i-i</i> (pp. 153-68); (4) the Akkadian present <i>iparras</i> is original, but somewhat later than the preterite; (5) the ending *-u* is a subjunctive from the earliest Semitic stages; (6) adjectives are primary with stative roots, prefixed finite forms are primary with fientive roots (pp. 192-201).
