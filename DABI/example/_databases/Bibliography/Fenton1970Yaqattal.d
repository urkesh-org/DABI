Ugaritic evidence and modern literature (especially GOETZE) on the possibility of a formation *yaqattal* in Northwest Semitic are examined, and a negative conclusion is reached. If Akkadian *iqattal* is in fact to be linked with South&#45;Semitic forms, one must assume either that *yaqattal*, though originally common Semitic, was lost in Northwest Semitic, or (and more likely, according to Fenton) that *yaqattal* was "created only in a part of the Semitic (Hamito&#363;Semitic) area and never spread over the entire area."
