Adverbs ending in *-atta(m),* *-atti* occur in Babylonian and even more frequently in Assyrian, but never in poetry. The best known function is for adverbs of manner, but in OB it occurs also for adverbs of time. The ending is to be analyzed as *-att-* plus *-am* or *-i* (< *&#42;ay*). The latter two elements occur also indepandently as adverbial endings. The element *-att-* is "ain pronominales Element zum Ausdruck der Zugeh&ouml;rigkeit" occurring in the possessive pronouns of the type *attuka* "yours," and possibly related to the Hebrew "nota accusativi" (Brockelmann) and the *-t-* marker of accusative found in the Akkadian personal pronouns and in Cushitic.
