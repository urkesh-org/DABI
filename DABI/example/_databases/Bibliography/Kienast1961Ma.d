On the basis of 15 texts shows that *m&#257;* occurs not only in Mari (Von
Soden) but also in OB, OA and literary Bab. It is found only in direct speech (or in letters inasmuch as they imitate direct-speech),
and it serves to introduce a rethorical or ironical question, with
a meaning such as "What?!", "How?!", "How come?!".
