Here goes the **summary**. Remarks on the most important patterns. Note especially: Fi&#8219;1 is for substantives from transitive roots (e. g. oilsum), fu&#8219;l is for substantives from adjectival roots (pusgum), fa&#8219;1 for (l) primary nouns (i. e. concrete objects, qarnum) , (2) substantivized adjectives (aplum), and (3) very few substantives from verbal roots (patru); the adjective of the 5 stem is a true Elative as in Arabic.
