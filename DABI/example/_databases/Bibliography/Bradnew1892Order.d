A statistical study on word order in Assyrian royal Instripctions from the Middle Assyrian
period down to Adad-Nirari III; the data are given first separately for each king, then tabulated for all
kings together. Out of a total of 2249 sentences, only 75 show an inverted order with the object occurring
after the predicate, 36 of these being found in only one king (A&#353;&#353;umasirpal). In the text of the article, 
the cases of inverted order are studied more closely, with a fine sense for style; the main reasons
for inversion are chiastic order, occurrence at the end of a paragraph, formulaic expressions, desire for 
close connection or euphonic structure, and emphasis. (The continuation of the article, promised at the end, unfortunately never appeared).
