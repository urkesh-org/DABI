Synonyms or words with similar meaning occur in regular sequences, the criteria for the arrangement of the words being that words which are shorter for number and/or quantity of syllables occur in initial, while words which are longer occur in final positions, e.g. *uşşu* — *mulmullu*. Word units may also be used in place of single long word, e.g.* narū ū  šumu šaṭru, surrāti ū lā kēnāti, bā’irum  nūši biltim*. The principle applies also for sentence structure, so that within the same sentence long clauses follow shorter ones, e.g. *appul, aqqur, ina išāti ašrup*. Applications of the theory follow, with respect to lexical texts (pp. 25-34) and conceptual categories (pp. 36-49).
