The purpose of this paper is to investigate the topic of divine repentance in Near Eastern literary sources, offering a comparative analysis of texts stemming from Mesopotamia and Israel. While doing this, the author also investigates the theme of divine anthropopatism, its religious implications and the role of repentance in the story of the Flood, in Mesopotamia and in the Hebrew Bible.

The subject of God's repentance in the Hebrew Bible has been discussed several times by scholars in light of its profound theological implications, but this topic did not raise a similar interest in scholars of the ancient Mesopotamia. This may be due primarily to the lack of Sumerian or Akkadian words that could express the concepts of repentance and/or remorse. An analysis of the accounts of the Flood as reported in *When Gods Were Men* and *Genesis* 6-9, however, shows that both these narratives refer more or less explicitly to the presence of divine repentance: the different rendering finds its justification in the cultural milieu within which these texts were written, in the different way to express feelings and emotions according to a very specific lexicon, and in the contrasting perception of man's relationship with the supernatural.

Indeed, despite being described in the available original written sources in unequivocal anthropomorphic and anthropopathic terms, Mesopotamian gods do not (or, better said, they cannot) repent. Conversely, YHWH does repent - and he does so more than once, according to the Hebrew Bible. The main reason for these different attitudes should be detected in the fact that Near Eastern gods do not love their human creatures nor do they feel any emotional attachment towards humankind; on the contrary, YHWH is profoundly and directly involved in the destiny of humanity and deeply concerned by the way humans live.
