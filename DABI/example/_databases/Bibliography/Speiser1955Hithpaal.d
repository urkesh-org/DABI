There are several unrecognized *Btn* forms in Hebrew which have in common with Akkadian an iterative and habitativa, or durative, aspect, as with *muttalliku* / *mithall&#257;k* "walking about, wanderer." Differing from Goetze, "Intensive," Speiser prefers to deal <with an unatomized *tan-* element in its amply attested normal sense.>
