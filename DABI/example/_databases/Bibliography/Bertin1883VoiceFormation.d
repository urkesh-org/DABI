Discusses the elements used in the formation of stems ("voices") in Semitic, with ample role given to Akkadian, see esp, about n (392), &#353; (395 f.), t (398), tn (403-6) and length (410-12). Of particular interest is the analysis of the &#353; stem as utilizing the same element of the personal pronoun *&#353;i*: thereby "the prefix to the verbal stem is an objective pronoun" and "the action of the verb is naturally thrown from the speaker on to another absent person represented by the prefix; so, in Assyrian, *altum* 'I concealed", shapel *u&#353;aktum* [sic] 'I (did that) one concealed, i.e "I caused to conceal"" (395); in WSem. we find a hiphil instead of a shaphel because the personal pronom is hu (396) [see SPEISER 1936 "Formatives"]. The main conclusion is in favor of an original biradical root.
