This volume is made of two parts: in the first, the author presents thematic analyses of a large number of Near Eastern building accounts (for example the Gudea cylinders, several Assyrian, Babylonian and Northwest Semitic royal inscriptions, biblical and post-biblical Jewish accounts). Then, in the second part he offers a comparative study of biblical accounts of the building of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem against the background of the sources previously examined. Hurowitz aims to elucidate the biblical source and, in order to reach his goal, he turns to comparative sources in order to identify applicable models.

The scholar ultimately concludes that the biblical building account is best understood precisely against the background of the ancient Near Eastern literary patterns, and that it should be qualified as a distinct genre. Not considering such comparative approach would result in a lack of understanding of the original sense of the biblical accounts themselves.
