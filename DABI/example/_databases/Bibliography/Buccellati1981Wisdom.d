The paper presents a description of the Mesopotamian pantheon as an ‘open’ and ‘closed’ system at the same time. This basic dichotomy is exemplified by means of some specific features of Mesopotamian wisdom literature (and also cultic practices), involving the topics of ‘fate’, ‘destiny’, ‘theodicy’, and ‘revelation’.

*Paragraph II.A* (pp. 36-37) specifically focuses on **religion**, defined as <<an institution which may be said, briefly, to regulate the **relationship between man and the absolute**. One pivotal point in this relationship is the very concept of the absolute>> (p. 36). 

In Mesopotamian thought, a dichotomy is emphasized, between an **open system**, the **pantheon** (<<a kaleidoscopic repertoire of divinities who personify various aspects of reality>>, p. 36), and a **closed system**, because <<the corollary intrinsic in a polytheistic system is that the components of the system, the gods, **place limits on each other**>> (p. 36). Under this respect, <<we find in Mesopotamia, as a counterpart of the polytheistic system, a closed system which views the absolute as being above internal variation>> (p. 36).

This dichotomy is clearly evident in the Mesopotamian concept of **fate**: <<Fate is not a god because it is not the personification of any single aspect of reality>> (p. 36); nevertheless, fate is embedded <<for instance, in those myths where fate is presented as an object, the **tablets of destiny**>> (p. 36). Fate is also involved in two aspects of Mesopotamian practices and concepts, i.e. those of **divination** and **Theodicy**: <<Divination may be considered as the ritual pertaining to fate’s causality in human affairs. Similarly, we may say that some of the reflective literature, such as the Theodicy, may be viewed as the correlative of a mythological statement about fate. … the Theodicy is not the vindication of a given god or of the open polytheistic system, but rather a statement about the ultimate validity of the absolute>> (p. 36).

Furthermore, <<the texts which deal with the open polytheistic system propound an axiomatic view of the divine world. It can be compared to an **immanent revelation**, i.e. an obvious reality which makes itself known simply by being there. **Transcendent revelation** is not unknown, but is limited to the communication of specific messages, rather than being the **self-revelation** of the divine sphere … . Normally, therefore, knowledge of the **divine world** is simply assumed as obvious, without transcendent revelation and without theological reasoning: the **metaphor** is the main device to convey, present and describe what is already apparent. In contrast with this, we have texts [i.e., divination texts and omina] exhibiting a more inquisitive attitude-and these are the same texts which presuppose a closed system of the absolute>> (p. 37).
