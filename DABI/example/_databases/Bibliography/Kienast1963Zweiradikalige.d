An attempt to reconstruct the inflectional system of biconsonantal verbal roots as a whole, rather than explaining single forms in isolation. Three main types are distinguished. (l) *PIS* including transitives *I W* (*bil*), fientive *I n* (*din*) and *izuzzum* (*ziz*), with the following reconstructed biconsonantal inflection:
|   B    |         *?*              |            *?*           |               *?*               | *&#42;bil*               | *&#42;yabil*             | *&#42;yatabal*   | *&#42;yabbal*             |
|   D    | *&#42ebbulum*            |            *?*           | *&#42;mubbilum*                 | *&#42;ebbil*             | *&#42;yabbil*            |        *?*       | *&#42;yabbal*             |
| &#352; | *&#42;&#353;&#363;bulum* | *&#42;&#353;&#363;bulum* | *&#42;mu&#353;&#363;bilum*      | *&#42;&#353;&#363;bil*   | *&#42;ya&#353;&#363;bil* |        *?*       | *&#42;ya&#353;&#363;bbal* |
|   Bt   | *&#42;tabulum*           |            *?*           | *&#42;mutabilum*                | *&#42;tabal*             |           *---*          |       *---*      | *&#42;yatabbal*           |

Note that doubling of the first radical is
typical of this class, and that the original
form of the *&#352;* pret./pres. preserves the original
causative particle as assumed by Speiser.
Diversions from this scheme in the historical
paradigms are based on analogical explanations,
of which the following are interesting: the
first vowel of B *ubbal* and *ubil* is on analogy
of *&#352;*, since both transitives *I w* and the *&#352;*
stem describe involuntary action; the prothetic
vowel found in *itbulum*, *itabbal*, *idin* derive
from the imperative *D* where a prothetic vowel
was necessarv to preserve the doubling of the
first radical typical of *D*. (2)*PSI*,
closely analogous to the triconsonantal patterns. (3) *P&#362;S* with retention of vocalic length whenever
possible, and lengthening of second consonant when required.
