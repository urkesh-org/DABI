The introduction deals briefly with the notion of dual from the point of view of historical linguistics. The first part reviews the data in the individual languages; Akkadian is treated on pp. 36-46 (based on secondary literature): the dual is productive in Old. Akk., and used also for occasional dual (i.e. for objects not occurring naturally in pairs); from OB on it becomes archaic and restricted pratically to natural pairs; in the verb, the dual is only archaic. The second part of the book reviews in detail the secondary literature on the Semitic dual; Akk. appears substantively only on p. 199 f., where it is used to prove the existence of the dual in Proto-Semitic.
