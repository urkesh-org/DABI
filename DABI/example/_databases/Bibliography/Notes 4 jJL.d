TO perception; neurology; patterns

On "repetitive patterns" of human perception and behavior, it is interesting to note that a strong neural correlate exists for this activity. One influential work on the issue is D. Hebb's *The Organization of Behavior*. See an introduction [here](https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-020-00567-8#Sec1).

TO rationality; science

Buccellati's affirmation that divination, astrology, and magic are eminently rational procedures may suggest that these practices are the beginnings of what we call science. Oppenheim cautions against too rapid a conclusion in this sense: <<Unwarranted seem to me to be the claims that the word lists with names of plants, animals, and stones, are the beginnings of botany, zöology, and mineralogy, respectively. Such claims originate in the climate of today’s opinion in which achievements in what we choose to term “science” are considered essential in an alien civilization if it is to be worthy of study. What we have to see in these numerous and diversified lists is much the same process of growth by accretion, the same preference for additive elaboration and amplification (rather than structural changes) which we can observe in Mesopotamian legal practices, in the evolution of the votive inscriptions, in the layout of a temple, to mention some few examples. A formally very simple and short pattern is utilized by the scribes to render a large variety of complex and elaborate contents. In this way the form as such does not exercise any tyranny, nor does it coerce the content, but serves as vehicle; in fact, it forms a matrix for a progressive development.>> Chapter 5,  {B}R/Oppenheim1964Mesopotamia

TO event; faith

Buccellati's account of the radical difference between biblical "faith" and mesopotamian polytheism is reminiscent of the theological term "event", as used by L. Giussani, R. Guardini, and E. Fuchs, among others.
