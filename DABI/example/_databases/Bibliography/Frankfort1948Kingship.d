TO politics and religion; Mesopotamian kingship

<<Frankfort's central thesis in *Kingship and the Gods* is that the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations differed fundamentally and profoundly despite their superficial resemblances, and that **kingship**, an institution which the ancients themselves regarded as the very foundation of all civilized life, was conceived of quite differently in the two lands. *Kingship and the Gods* is divided into two books and seven parts: Book I, in four parts, is devoted to Egypt; Book II, in three parts, is devoted to Mesopotamia. Preceding Book I is a brief Introduction that focuses on the contrasting views of kingship in the two societies as expressed in their art>> (from OI’s website).

[In Book II, the author presents a discussion on the origin and nature of Mesopotamian kingship, specifically focusing on the **relationship between king, gods, and nature** (Part VII), analysing also the topic of the identification of the king with specific gods and the deification of kings in Mesopotamia.]
